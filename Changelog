Changes 6.9.88 -> 6.9.89:
* Editor: Fix crash when quantitizing notes. Bug
  introduced in 6.9.80.
* Windows32: Fix import MOD.
* Macos: Open Help windows in an external browser
  since the manual now uses javascript-features not
  supported by QtWebkit 5.9.
* Manual: Include search field + various other
  improvements.
* Faust: Fix possible performance problem for the
  interpreter backend.
* API:
  * gui_web: Handle local files with queries.
  * gui_web: Only accept Escape key if currently
    searching. (Previously it hindered all other
    usage of the Escape key by web pages.)



Changes 6.9.86 -> 6.9.88:
* Editor/Instrument: Enable sample-seek by default.
* Macos: Runs under Macos 11.
* Windows: Antivirus programs should never scan
  LADSPA plugins during startup anymore.
* JUCE: Don't allocate memory in realtime code for
  VST3 plugins when setting parameter values.
* Editor: Fix "Rec" not being removed immediately
  after stopping to record MIDI input.
* Linux: Fix JUCE thread issues which might have
  caused glitches in sound when using VST plugins.
* JUCE: Upgrade to V6.0.8. Most important change is
  probably support for VST3 plugins on Linux.



Changes 6.9.82 -> 6.9.86:
* Audio: Try not to open any audio input device by
  default. Sometimes this screws up the output
  sound.
* Audio: Try to use a default buffer size of 1024
  when initializing the audio device. Earlier the
  audio device was sometimes initialized with an
  incompatible block size.
* Sequencer: Fix inserting several audio files at
  once when selecting "Insert audio file(s)" from
  the popup menu. For a few releases now, inserting
  several audio files inserted the new audio files
  into the wrong sequencer tracks.
* Sequencer: Also set seqtrack-under-mouse when
  changing current seqtrack.
* Sequencer: Fix moving several seqblocks at once
  when there are hidden seqtracks.
* Sequencer: Light up seqtrack names, both in
  seqtrack headers and in the "Tracks" tab, when
  mouse is above.
* Sequencer: Light up the editable path name field in
  the "Files" tab when mouse is above.
* Sequencer: Light up seqtrack currently under mouse.
* Sequencer: Fix keybindings not always working on
  current seqtrack pointed to by the mouse.
* Sequencer: Paint orange border around current
  seqblock in the sequencer navigators.
* Sequencer: Fix possible weird behavior when moving
  more than one seqblock and one or more of those
  seqblocks were deleted because they were moved to
  a seqtrack of the wrong type.
* GUI: Make all sliders in the editor/mixer/sequencer
  to light up when mouse is above the slider.
* Mixer: Make the volume text and peak text light up
  when mouse is above.
* Editor: Convert various node assertions to fire in
  debug builds only.
* Editor: Fix moving cursor left when the cursor is
  positioned on the leftmost centtext subtrack and
  the swing subtrack is visible.
* Editor: Fix transposing selected notes in the
  pianoroll when using left meta + u/d.
* Editor: Improve logic for whether to show the
  centtext subtrack or not.
* Editor: Convert pitches to TimeData.
  * The most notable change is that any editing is
    heard immediately if playing block or song at
    the same time.
  * Using less CPU cache. CPU usage might be notably
    lower after notes themselves have been converted
    to the new data structure.
  * Necessary for future work such as replacing
    OpenGL with Vulkan.
* Editor: Fix transpose velocity.
* Build: Fix compiling for LLVM12 (Teteros)
* Editor: Let the window that shows the
  no-range-or-selection error show buttons to open
  the manual instead of explaining directly how to
  edit range and selection.
* Editor: Make sure editor graphics is updated when
  pressing left alt + return.
* API: setCurrSeqtrackUnderMouse



Changes 6.9.81 -> 6.9.82:
* Editor: Don't show assertion window when changing
  the number of lines in a block causes a note to
  be shortened. Bug introduced in 6.9.80



Changes 6.9.80 -> 6.9.81:
* Load: Fix program freeze if loading a song with a
  VST/AU plugin from the command line. Was probably
  only a problem on Linux.
* VST/AU: Enable all audio channels of VST/AU plugins
  when the plugin is initiated since some plugins
  don't enable all channels by default. For instance,
  the U-he Runciter plugin only enables one of its
  channels. In the future there should be an option
  to select bus layout for plugins
* Editor: Fix inserting a new note below another note
  in a non-polyphonic matter, i.e. so that the end of
  the first note stops where the second note starts.
  This could in some situations fail spectacularly.
  Bug introduced in 6.9.80



Changes 6.9.75 -> 6.9.80:
* Windows/Editor: Another workaround to fix garbled
  fonts sometimes happening in the editor right after
  startup.
* Editor: Changed the behavior when pressing DEL on a
  veltext entry so that it behaves the same way as
  when deleting a velocity node with the mouse.
* Manual: Minor updates.
* Sequencer: Make it optional in preferences
  whether changing current seqtrack also changes
  current editor block. Also disable this option by
  default, before it was enabled.
* Sequencer: Add option in preferences whether mouse
  wheel up/down starts/stops playing or scrolls
  up/down seqtracks.
* Sequencer: New option in preferences to select
  whether to autoselect the seqtrack which is
  currently below the mouse pointer. In addition,
  turn this option OFF by default (before this
  behavior was ON).
* Mixer: Change the "Connected to main pipe" option
  in the popup menus to "Connected to main bus".
* Preferences/colors: Add slider to adjust the amount
  of gradient colors of various filled rectangles.
* GUI: Various tweaks to color shading.
* Preferences/colors: Fix setting correct default
  values for the saturation and brightness sliders
  when pressing "Reset".
* Sequencer: New option in preferences to select
  whether to autoselect block currently under the
  mouse pointer. In addition, turn this option OFF by
  default (before this behavior was ON).
* Load: Add workaround for loading songs saved with
  Radium older than 6.9.76. Before that there was a
  bug that caused no volume change to be played if
  there were only two velocity nodes for a note and
  the last node had value 0 (i.e. plain
  decrescendo where not played).
* GUI: Made the green audio peak color greener.
* Mixer: Paint a handler for the volume sliders to
  better see current value.
* Colors: Adjusted check box colors a little bit.
* Modulator: Fix division by zero if min and max is
  equal. (This caused illegal floating points to
  wander around in the system).
* Audio: Assert that the value is a legal floating
  point when setting plugin parameters.
* Editor: Convert note velocities to the new data
  structure:
  * The most notable change is that any editing is
    heard immediately if playing block or song at
    the same time.
  * Using less CPU cache. CPU usage might be notably
    lower after notes themselves have been converted
    to the new data structure.
  * Coincidentally fixed a bug that caused no
    volume change to be heard if there were only
    two velocity nodes for a note and the last node
    had value 0 (i.e. plain decrescendos were not
    played). Also add a workaround for this bug so
    that loading old songs still sound the same.
  * Necessary for future work such as replacing
    OpenGL with Vulkan.
* Editor: Don't delete note when deleting the last
  velocity node and there are pitch changes unless
  there are only two velocity nodes.
* Loading: Fix showing correct line numbers when
  loading song fails.
* Internal: Various improvements to the RT memory
  allocator.
* API:
  * New: autoselectEditorBlockUnderMouse,
    setAutoselectEditorBlockUnderMouse,
    getAmountOfGradient, setAmountOfGradient,
    autoselectSeqtrackUnderMouse,
    setAutoselectSeqtrackUnderMouse,
    autoselectEditorBlockWhenChangingSeqtrack,
    setAutoselectEditorBlockWhenChangingSeqtrack,
    sequencerMouseScrollWheelStartsStopsPlaying,
    setSequencerMouseScrollWheelStartsStopsPlaying.
  * Change last argument (gradient) for gui_filledBox
    from boolean to int, and add 13 different types of
    gradients to choose from.



Changes 6.9.74 -> 6.9.75:
* GUI: Tweak default background color of the editor
  and the modular mixer.
* Audio/MIDI: Fix erroneous error message
  ("RT_free failed") possibly being displayed when
  sending and receing MIDI from VST plugins. Bug
  probably introduced around 6.9.66.
* Sequencer: Warn about non-linear mapping if
  loading an older song that has Crossover
  automation for the sampler instrument.
* Editor: Warn about non-linear mapping if loading
  an older song that has Crossover automation for
  the sampler instrument.
* Mixer: Made it possible to configure the
  background color of the modular mixer separately.
* Sampler instrument: Fix loading songs with custom
  loops.
* API: Fix wrong error message possibly being
  displayed when sending/receiving MIDI.



Changes 6.9.72 -> 6.9.74:
* GUI: Made it possible to configure all label
  colors. Before this, it was hardcoded to light
  gray.
* Sequencer: Made it possible to configure the
  editor seqtrack header backgound color
  separately. Before, it just used the "Sequencer
  background" color.
* Sampler instrument: Made the crossfade slider
  exponential so that it'll be possible to set
  accurate small values.
* Sequencer: Paint name of current editor seqblock
  in white color also in the navigator widgets.
* GUI: Adjust default colors a little bit.
* Editor: Fix assertion reporter popping up when
  changing number of tracks in "block properties"
  while playing.
* GUI: Paint gradient background color for various
  text.
* Editor: Tweak tempo multiplier slider graphics a
  little bit. Also make the colors for the slider
  configurable.
* Playlist: Use same colors as in the sequencer and
  paint a border around current entries instead of
  using a different background color. Also paint a
  small border around non-current entries.
* Sample instrument/Fluidsynth instrument: Make sure
  the sample browser is wide enough to show all text
  of normal-sized filenames.
* GUI: Make all buttons have the "Buttons" color.
* GUI: Make group boxes easier to see.
* Sampler instrument: Support loop crossfade when
  using custom loop start/end points.
* Sampler instrument: New effect "Loop window".
* Internal: Change main timer interval from 5ms to
  15ms. This might lighten up CPU usage a little bit.



Changes 6.9.71 -> 6.9.72:
* Sequencer: Add a "Duplicate seqblock and block"
  option to the editor seqblock popup menu.
* Mixer: Make current mixer slot color red.

  help text color.
* Menus: Fix selecting "Show/Hide Mixer" and
  "Show/Hide Sequencer" without using shortcuts.
* Editor: Fix editing BPM. Bug introduced in 6.8.71.



Changes 6.9.69 -> 6.9.71:
* Linux: Fix importing MOD files in the binaries.
  (Probably broken in 6.7.76.)
* Sampler instrument / Fluidsynth instrument: Made
  soundfile text color a little bit darker.
* Editor: Display "Automatically set pianoroll
  range" in the status bar when the mouse pointer is
  above an "A" button in the track headers.
* Sampler instrument: Fix sample browser stealing
  keyboard focus when the current instrument is
  changed to an instrument that had keyboard focus
  inside the sample browser the last time it was
  used.
* Editor: Don't show assertion reporter in release
  mode when note structure is slightly corrupt.
* Sampler instrument: Fix illegal samples being
  played if loading an audio file with less than 32
  samples, or a sample loop is less than 32 samples.
  Fixes playing chip tune MOD songs for instance.
  Bug introduced in 6.5.81
* Sequencer: If soundfile is shorter than last time
  it was used in Radium, also cut seqblock
  automation so that nodes are not placed after the
  end of the file (where they can't be edited).
* Build: Fix faust llvm build. Should fix #1339
* Sequencer: Give more detailed information if a
  sound file couldn't be opened.
* Sequencer: Handle properly if an audio file is
  physically replaced with a file with different
  number of channels while the program is running.

* Windows: Fix showing current system font when
  opening the "change system font" requester.
* Windows: Fix using "Lato Black" as the default
  system font.
* Editor: Fix hanging notes when recording MIDI and
  not using Jack. MIDI recording accuracy, though,
  is slightly worse now when not using jack for
  audio. This can be compensated by using smaller
  audio buffers.
* Load: Fix assertion window popping up when loading
  some songs. The assertion was innocent though. Bug
  introduced in 6.9.63.
* Song properties: Remove option to select 2 or 8
  channel main pipe.

  buses from pipes to sequencer buses.
* Audio: Rename "Main Pipe" to "Main Bus".
* Audio: Remove the "Enable piping" effect
  from sequencer buses.

  visible by default. The 5 effect buses are not
  visible by default.
* Macos: Fix importing mod files
* Internal: Various changes.
* API:
  * New: getInstrumentEffects, setInstrumentEffects,
    seqtrackIsPermanent, seqtrackIsBus, moveSeqtrack,
    internalReplacePermanent.
  * Let appendSeqtrack, appendEditorSeqtrack,
    appendAudioSeqtrack, and appendBusSeqtrack
    return the seqtrack number for the newly created
    seqtrack.
  * Rename sendSysex -> sendMidiSysex.



Changes 6.9.66 -> 6.9.67:
* Macos: Fix error about not being able to set
  realtime priority. Bug introduced in 6.9.63.
* API:
  * New: sendSysex.
  * Make midi input callbacks also receive syex
    messages.



Changes 6.9.64 -> 6.9.66:
* Audio: Fix random data sent out of "System In"
  instruments when not using jack and the soundcard
  has less input channels than the "System In"
  instrument has output channels.
* Audio: Fix losing the jack port names of
  "System in" and "System out" instruments when a
  song is saved when not running jack. This caused
  the message "Could not register jack port" when
  later loading the song using jack.
* MIDI: Possible fix for rare situations of hanging
  notes.

  priority inversion when sending midi from main
  thread.
* Audio: Turn off realtime priority when rendering
  audio file.
* API: sendMidiMessage, openMidiOutputPort,
  closeMidiOutputPort, openMidiInputPort,
  closeMidiInputPort, closeAllMidiInputPorts,
  getMidiOutputPortNames, getMidiInputPortNames.



Changes 6.9.63 -> 6.9.64:
* Windows: Fix possible dropouts if changing audio
  settings after startup when not using jack.



Changes 6.8.71 -> 6.9.63:
* Bottom bar: Improve displaying CPU usage.
* Bottom bar: Show number of xruns.
* Sampler instrument: Fix a bug sometimes causing
  wrong custom loop points after loading song. Bug
  seems to have been introduced in 6.7.76.
* Audio: Fix rare possible crash when undoing
  deleting instrument.

  getNumXruns.



Changes 6.7.76 -> 6.8.71:
* Scripting: Update S7.
* NSM: Never autoconnect jack ports when nsm is
  active.
* Editor/mouse: Fix moving an element after
  previously moving that element beyond a limit.
  Before, when moving that element again, the
  element would automatically jump the same number
  of pixels in the opposite direction first. (The
  fix was only necessary on Linux and Windows.)
* Modulators: Don't break chronological order when
  adding or removing a modulator.
* Mixer: Keep crologocial order for the plugin
  favourites.
* Fonts: Display currently used font in font
  requester when changing editor font or system
  font.
* Fonts: Fix saving custom editor font to settings.
* Editor/cursor: Try to move to the same subtrack
  when using Ctrl + J.
* Editor/cursor: Make sure cursor is visible after
  changing zoom value.
* Editor/cursor: Make sure the complete current
  track is visible when scrolling left/right and
  there's enough space. Before, we only made sure
  the complete current subtrack was visible.
* Editor/cursor: Fix showing full subtrack when
  moving cursor to a subtrack that is outside the
  visible area.
* Editor/cursor: Fix cursor sometimes moving to the
  wrong place when moving left or right in the
  timing tracks.
* Editor/cursor: Fix cursor moving to the same
  subtrack when moving cursor to the left or right
  track.
* Editor/FX: Convert FX (i.e. effect automation in
  the editor) to the new data structure:
  * Better performance (should be more notable in
    later releases though).
  * Changes are heard immediately and player never
    has to be paused.
  * Necessary for future plans.
* Editor/FX: Fix popup menu for adding an already
  used FX to a track.
* Editor/FX: When creating new FX, make sure the
  initial length is equal to visible line length
  (i.e. take LZ into account).
* API:
  * New: setCurrentTrack, getCurrentTrack,
    getCurrentSubtrack, getTrackVisible,
    canCursorMoveToTrack, getLeftmostCursorTrack.
  * Make -2 the default subtrack value for
    setCurrentTrack.



Changes 6.7.75 -> 6.7.76:
* Windows: Fix import MOD when the username contains
  non-ascii characters.
* Windows: Fix displaying filename with non-ascii
  characters in the progress window when importing
  MOD files.
* Audio: Don't show error about not being able to
  open soundfont file when failed loading a sound
  file (we already show a general message about
  not being able to open the file).
  a file doesn't exist. 
* Sequencer: Fix error messages popping up after
  pressing the Esc key when prompted to manually
  write new path in the file browser.
* Windows: Fix displaying paths with non-ascii
  characters in the file browser in the right-side
  sequencer tabs.
* Editor: Add options to set high priority for the
  OpenGL render thread and the OpenGL drawer thread.
* Preferences: Remove the OpenGL "Safe mode" option.

  don't want to touch this option).
* Preferences: Move the "OpenGL" tab to the right of
  the "GUI" tab.
* API: Add "message_is_base64" option to
  openProgressWindow



Changes 6.7.74 -> 6.7.75:

  in v6.7.74. Version number was wrong too.



Changes 6.7.72 -> 6.7.74:
* Audio: Disable lots of debug outputs to the
  terminal when modifying the audio graph. (Debug
  and Delease mode were switched.) This also might
  fix some audio glitches.
* Windows: Fix garbled font rendering sometimes
  happening in the editor. Bug introduced in v6.7.69.
  (The problem existed before 6.7.69 too, but not
  as often).

  v6.6.77. The bug probably only manifested in
  debug builds though, and not in any releases.
* Internal: Fix semi-rare memory leak when showing a
  system error message.
* NSM: Fix error message popping up after startup.
* Editor: Fix transposing MIDI 7 bit automation when
  pressing Left Alt + U or Left Alt + D and the
  cursor was placed inside an fxtext subtrack.
* MIDI: Fix crash when starting to play in the middle
  of a song at a position where there is MIDI
  automation in the editor.
* Build: Update libgig from 3.3.0 to 4.2.0. Fixes
  crash when loading some soundfonts.



Changes 6.7.71 -> 6.7.72:
* Editor: Fix notes not being stopped when adding a
  stop note. Bug introduced in 6.6.77.



Changes 6.7.70 -> 6.7.71:
* Audio meters: Fix update interval. In 6.7.70 it was
  by mistake updated each 5ms which is too often.



Changes 6.7.69 -> 6.7.70:
* Instruments: Fix editing keybinding in the
  instrument effects popup menu.
* Help: Add option in preferences to let the help
  windows be a standalone window.
* Plugin manager: Don't make the plugin manager
  window modal. Fixes inactive messages window after
  scanning plugins.
* API: helpWindowIsChildOfMainWindow,
  setHelpWindowIsChildOfMainWindow .



Changes 6.6.78 -> 6.7.69:
* GUI: Fix audio meters often not being updated each
  frame, even when there is enough CPU time.
* LADSPA: Remove TAP plugins from the regular menus.
* Macos: Show text box with info about the state of
  OpenGL during startup.

* Editor: Disable the bar/beat options for current
  track when current track is a timing track.
* Settings: Include "Radium reset" program to reset
  user settings.
* Manual: Make sure the same font is used on all
  platforms. Most importantly this fixes really bad
  text rendering on Windows.
* API: getTrackTypeName.
 


Changes 6.6.77 -> 6.7.68:
* Faust: Upgrade Faust from 2.27.2-stable to
  20201227-dev.
* OpenGL: Make sure editor is always correct size
  after startup.
* Linux: The Radium binaries now requires glibc 2.27
  or newer. The binaries should work on the
  following Linux distributions (and newer):
  Arch Linux (current), Debian 10, Fedora 27,
  Manjaro 17, Mint 19, MX Linux 19,
  openSuse Tumbleweed, Redhat/Centos 8,
  Slackware (current), and Ubuntu 18.
* MacOS: Radium now requires macOS 10.13 or newer.
* Build: Upgrade Qt to 5.15.2.
* Faust: Update FAUST package from 20191222-dev to
  2.27.2-stable. (Teteros)
* Linux: Show stronger warning about the Novueau
  driver during startup. The Nouveau driver is
  likely to freeze your computer if running Radium.



Changes 6.5.86 -> 6.6.77:
* Macos: Include updated LADSPA plugins.
* Windows/Macos: Include a new version of qjackctl
  that doesn't set sample rate and period size unless
  they're explicitly set to custom values. Might fix
  problems people have starting Jack on Windows.
* Windows/Macos: Include a new program called
  "qjackctl_reset" that resets qjackctl-settings back
  to default. Can be useful to make Jack run (again).
* Windows: Update documentation for installing the
  ASIO Jack driver (it's not a part of Jack anymore).
* Settings: Make it impossible to corrupt the config
  file.
* NSM: Don't autoconnect ports when NSM is active.
* Settings: Fix writing if the config file (for some
  reason) have become an empty file.
* Internal: New data structure for storing editor
  data. The new data structur supports reading and
  writing from multiple threads without blocking. So
  far only the note-stops have been converted to the
  new data structure, but eventually everything
  should be converted. Then we will see better
  realtime behavior and better performance in general
  because of less CPU cache hits. This is also
  preparation work for replacing OpenGL with Vulkan.



Changes 6.5.85 -> 6.5.86:
* Audio: Fix loading and saving plugins that have
  effect names with lineshifts.



Changes 6.5.84 -> 6.5.85:
* GUI: Improve Qt recursion detection. Hopefully
  there won't be false positives on macos now.

  if going into an endless recursive loop.
* Sequencer: Remember current seqtrack when undoing
  and redoing.
* Sequencer: Remove flickering when undoing and
  redoing.
* Build: Fix compiling Pd using gcc/clang 10+
  (Teteros).
* Mixer strips: Fix width of the arrow separating
  non-bus and bus strips.



Changes 6.5.82 -> 6.5.83:
* Mixer strips: Set max width of a strip.
* Mixer strips: Pack strips to the left if the
  strips can't fill all available horizontal space.
  Instead of spreading them out evenly, that is.
* Sequencer: Keep track on/off and fade data when
  replacing block or audiofile in seqblock.
* Sampler instrument: Fix playing reverse sample in
  non-looping mode.
* Plugins: Fixes displaying correct number of
  channels for VST2 plugins in the plugin manager.



Changes 6.5.81 -> 6.5.82:
* Audio: Fix more than half of VST2 plugins being
  loaded as mono plugins, even when they are not.
  (The fix uses code written by falkTX.)
* Sequencer: Fix memory leak in automation painter.
* Sampler instrument: Display sustain value as dB.



Changes 6.5.79 -> 6.5.81:
* Mixer: Change function used when assigning
  keybinding to "Generate new color" in the popup
  menu. Before: generateNewInstrumentColor.
  Now: generateNewColorForAllSelectedInstruments.
* Editor: Don't pause player when scrolling up or
  down when current editor-block is not playing.
* Editor: Never let player change editor-block when
  a block is editor-locked.
* Editor: Tweak keybindings for general transposing.
  Now they only work when the editor has keyboard
  focus.
* Sequencer: Fix horizontal alignment for the name
  of seqtracks when the names are too large for the
  assigned space.
* Sampler instrument: Make sample-seek work with
  looping.
* Sampler instrument: Fix crossfade when the start
  of the loop is higher than 0.
* Sampler instrument: Add "AHDSR on/off" effect.

  little bit.
* Sampler instrument: Fix ping-pong loop looping
  between loop start/end and not between the
  start/end of the sample.
* Sampler instrument: Make it possible to define
  custom start/end loop points.
* API: keepOldLoopWhenLoadingNewSample,
  setKeepOldLoopWhenLoadingNewSample,
  useSameLoopFramesWhenLoadingNewSample,
  setUseSameLoopFramesWhenLoadingNewSample.



Changes 6.5.78 -> 6.5.79:
* GUI: Fix crash when pressing the "Full" button in
  the instrument widget while the sequencer is
  inside the mixer.
* Instruments widget: Adjust width of the filter are
  and the output area.



Changes 6.5.77 -> 6.5.78:
* Audio: Show warning if loading an old song that
  indexes modulator effects by number instead of by
  name since wrong effects are most likley
  modulated. Also inform that the workaround is to
  load and save the song in Radium V5.9.44.
* Demo songs: Fix wrong effects being modulated in
  "Concrete Vox" and "Elf".
* Mixer: Fix updating instrument sliders after
  changing A/B. (The effects themselves were
  changed, but not the sliders.)
* Mixer: Index A/B instrument effects on disk by
  effect name and not by effect number. This
  prevents A/B settings from being incompatible
  again in future versions of the program.



Changes 6.5.76 -> 6.5.77:
* Mixer: When changing A/B, apply instrument state
  even when number of effects are different.
* Sampler instrument: Optimize applying AHDSR
  envelope. Might make a notable difference in CPU
  usage.



Changes 6.5.74 -> 6.5.76:
* Presets: Fix memory corruption in preset filename
  (i.e. .rec/.mrec files). Preset filename is shown
  in GUI and saved to disk, so this bug could cause
  corrupted .rad files. Bug probably introduced in
  6.5.72.
* Sequencer: Paint a thin blue line around
  waveforms.
* Sequencer: Change "Insert audio file" to
  "Insert audio file(s)". If selecting several audio
  files when using this function, the program will
  put all selected files into their own newly
  created audio seqtracks.
* Sequencer: Fix rare (probably) crash when undoing
  full sequencer state and topmost seqtrack was not
  the first seqtrack.
* Sequencer: Fix wall-of-text error messages popping
  up in the message window when scrolling in the
  "Sounds" tab on the right side of the sequencer.
* Sequencer: Disable the "Insert current audiofile"
  popup menu entry if there are no used audiofiles
  in the program.
* Soundfile saver: Don't create soundfiles for
  instruments that has no outputs, buses, pipes,
  and Click instruments if metronome is turned off.
* Soundfile saver: Fix saving multiple files, one
  for each instrument. Bug probably introduced in
  6.5.72.
* Scheduler: Fix rare assertion message popping up.
  Probably caused by a rounding error.
* Instrument widget: Add pitch shift slider. Options
  to apply pitch to:
  1. No channels
  2. Only even-numbered channels
  3. Only odd-numbered channels
  4. All channels
  5. All channels, but invert the pitch ratio of
     odd-numbered channels.
* Audio: Double the time it takes to fade in/out
  system effects.
* Mixer: Make it possible to assign keybindings to
  all entries in the "Insert sound object" popup
  menu.
* API:
  * New: setNativeInstrumentEffect
  * Add optional argument "several_files" to
    gui_fileRequester



Changes 6.5.73 -> 6.5.74:
* Audio: Remove some unnecessary audio buffers that
  were used when processing Ladspa plugins. Might
  decrease CPU usage by using less CPU cache for
  audio data. (Note that badly written Ladspa
  plugins could misbehave after this change.)
* Audio: Fix audio only in left channel for mono
  Ladspa plugins where plugin info was cached to
  avoid having to open the plugin during program
  startup. Bug introduced in 6.5.72



Changes 6.5.72 -> 6.5.73:
* Mixer: Don't crash if changing A/B while creating
  a connection.
* API:
  * Fix documentation for getInstrumentEffect and
    getNativeInstrumentEffect.
  * New: getStoredNativeInstrumentEffect.



Changes 6.4.77 -> 6.5.72:
* Windows: Fix borderless mixer window. Bug
  introduced in 6.4.76.
* Mixer: Fix remembering window position.
* Sampler instrument: Add entries to edit keybindings
  to the popup menu of the "R" button.
* Audio: Add entries to the instrument effect popup
  menu for adding keybinding to change effect
* GUI: Increase performance a little bit for effect
  sliders and other things.
* Instrument widget: Fix immediately updating graphics
  of solo and mute buttons when changing solo.
* Mixer: Add "Insert plugin" and "Connetion enabled"
  entries to the connection popup menu.
* Instruments: Remove the "T" (through) button for
  MIDI instruments (served no purpose).
* Audio: Cache ladspa plugin info so that they don't
  have to be loaded during program startup. Only
  info for included ladspa plugins are cached for
  now. This fixes very long startup time on windows
  when realtime virus scanning is enabled, but even
  startup times on Linux (and probably MacOS) is
  notably shorter.
* Audio: Generally improve CPU usage by being more
  aggresive about not mixing audio when the output
  of a sound object is silent.
* Audio: Increase audio level allowed to autosuspend
  a sound object. May lower CPU usage in some
  situations.
* Windows: Remove some unnecessary info from
  crashreporter message.
* Audio: Increase number of frames to fade out/in
  from 1024 to 2048 when changing mute on/off and
  various other things.
* Audio: Don't recalculate latencies on the fly when
  a sound object is muted, auto-suspended, volume set
  to 0, and possibly other situations. Although
  constantly running mimumum latencies uses less
  CPU, doing this can also cause audible artifacts.
  E.g. if a plugin reports a latency of 2048 frames,
  we always compensate for a latency of 2048 frames
  in parallel running sound objects in the audio
  graph, even when the plugin makes no sound.
* Modulators/preset: Fix modulator connections when
  loading .mrec files.
* Mixer: Fix undo when creating new sound object
  from preset file by using keybinding.
* Mixer: Fix assertion window popping up when
  creating new sound object from preset file by
  using keybinding.
* Mixer: Make it configurable which A/B settings to
  apply. Click the button with a settings icon to
  configure. The options are:
  * audio connections
  * event connections
  * volume
  * panning
  * mute/solo/bypass
  * system effects
  * instrument effects
  * instrument states
  * mixer strips configuration
  * remember current instrument
  * modulator connections.
  * system volume
  Only audio connections, event connections, volume,
  panning, "mute solo bypass", and "remember current
  instrument" are enabled by default in new songs.
* Sequencer: Fix wrong editor seqblock positions
  after undoing changing block tempos.
* Mixer: Update connection line gfx immediately
  after changing solo for an instrument.
* GUI: Fix Return and Enter keys working in tables.
  Bug introduced in last release .
* Plugins: When loading song, don't try to set
  illegal program number if program number on disk
  is a negative number or higher than the number of
  programs provded the plugin. Fixes crash in at
  least one AU plugin.
* Audio: Don't send events though (i.e. when "T" is
  enabled), when an instrument is implicitly muted
  and "Implicitly mute MIDI the same way as audio"
  is enabled.
* Audio: Fix updating implicit mute/solo when
  removing a connection.
* MIDI: Add the option "Implicitly mute MIDI the
  same way as audio" to song properties. I.e. when
  soloing, we also mute MIDI in implicitly muted
  instruments. This option is enabled by default for
  new songs, and disabled by default for old songs
  (to make sure they continue to sound the same).
* Audio: Make transition from one A/B setting to
  another much smoother. Now solo, connections, and
  instrument effects are all changed at the same
  time.
* Audio: Fix latency compensation being wrong in
  some (very) rare cases when recording from system
  input. Happened sometimes when there were event
  connections in the audio graph.
* Preferences: Make it clearer what latencies are
  used in the "Latency compensation when recording
  from system input" option.
* MIDI: Compensate for latency when playing notes.
  By default it only compensates for "System out"
  input-latency.
* Preferences: Changed tab order a little bit.
* Preferences: Moved various things from the "Audio"
  tab to the "Instruments" tab.
* Instrument widget: Support right-clicking the
  A/B-buttons and the GUI button.
* Sequencer: Less experimental default granulation
  parameters.
* Mixer: Remember current instrument in a/b.
* Instrument widget: Support right-clicking the
  "Replace" and "Load" buttons to configure
  keybindings.
* FaustDev: Fix missing info from the info window.
* Instrument widgets: Don't display multi-presets
  when asked to load/replace preset.
* Disk: Don't put program into an endless message
  loop when loading an erroneous .rad/.rec/etc.
  file.
* Instrument widget: Add "prev preset" and
  "next preset" buttons to quickly switch to
  previous or next preset in the directory where the
  instrument was loaded from (if loaded from preset
  file). If instrument was not loaded from a preset
  file, select prev/next preset from default or last
  used directory instead.
* Instruments: Save preset filename to disk if
  instrument was loaded from a preset file.
* Audio: Name VST/AU programs and not presets.
  "Program" is the common name, plus that "preset"
  can be confused with radium presets.
* Instruments widget: Remove the program number-
  widget. Incorporate the number into the program
  name-button instead.
* Instruments widget: Add "prev program" and "next
  program" buttons. Assign keybindings by
  right-clicking the buttons.
* Instruments widget: Immediately update autosuspend
  button graphics when changing autosuspending type.
* Audio: Change instruments to not send out events
  (i.e notes, MIDI messages, etc.) when they are
  muted. Same with bypass. Old songs behave as
  before, but this can be changed in the Song
  Properties.
* GUI: Draw an SVG image for the various "reset ab"-
  buttons. Before this, a question mark was drawn
  instead of the curly arrow utf-8 character when
  running on windows.
* Editor: Add option to select current block in the
  popup menu for the padlock-checkbox in the lower
  left corner.
* Sequencer: Remove graphical garbage from the row
  of pixels placed between the seqtrack headers and
  the area to the right of the headers.
* Editor: Fix various error messages popping up when
  switching current block while moving a pianonote.
* API:
 * New: getNumInstrumentPrograms,
   getCurrInstrumentProgram,
   setCurrInstrumentProgram,
   setInstrumentProgramName,
   getInstrumentProgramName, getDirPath,
   getPathWithoutDir, getInstrumentPresetPath,
   getInstrumentPreset, selectInstrumentConfigNum,

  assertions to pop up.
* Mixer: Fix no sound when inserting a Send to a
  sound object without audio outputs.
* Mixer: Reduce CPU usage.
* Mixer: Paint arrow on connections in the modular
  mixer.

  * Python: Support for the "Place" type.
  * Remove optional argument "force_delete" from
    deleteSeqtrack.
  * Don't allow sending negative place as argument
    for addNote to InsertNote. It's not a valid
    place and program isn't able to handle it
    either.

    end_counter, and end_dividor since none of them
    were legal.

  * removeSchedule: Release callback immediately.
    Minor memory usage improvement.
  * autoscrollSeqtracks: Add optional argument
    "make_fully_visible".

    swings on the same position.


Changes 5.9.96 -> 5.9.98:
* Windows: Some adjustments to make the 32 bits
  version run longer without running out of memory.
  More work needed here.
* Windows: Fix false positive malware detection in
  various VP software. Was mainly a problem with the
  32 bit version of Radium.
* MacOS: Fix mouse hovering in the editor not working
  since 5.9.86.
* Internal: Update S7
* Editor: Moving a selected note in the pianoroll
  causes all other pianonotes to be moved as well.
  Same when moving the start/end/node of a pianonote.
* Editor: Press Ctrl to select/unselect notes in the
  pianoroll.
* Editor: Press Ctrl and drag mouse to create note
  selection rectangle in the pianoroll.
* Internal: Upgrade JUCE from 5.4.3 to 5.4.7.
  * Linux: The old custom patches for the ALSA MIDI
    code in JUCE is still used, so there will be no
    change in the port naming scheme, or bad
    performance, even with the new version of JUCE.
* VST/AU: Eliminate use of an unnecessary
  input/output buffer. May reduce CPU cache hits if
  using many VST/AU plugins.
* Song properties: Extend the "Send global swing
  tempo to plugins and jack transport" text to
  include modulators, metronome, and jack tracksport
  as well.
* Editor: Don't move FX if cursor is placed on a
  chancetext or centtext subtrack when pressing
  backspace or alt+backspace.
* Editor: Make backspace and alt+backspace only
  operate on current FX if cursor is placed on an
  FX text subtrack.

  alt + backspace result in a change.
* Editor: Make it possible to input rational and
  decimal numbers for shift+return.
* Editor: Use ratios instead of floats for
  calculation when pressing backspace and
  alt+backspace. This fixes situations where
  rounding errors caused notes and other events to
  sometimes be placed right below the start of a
  line.
* Internal: Various assertions that float and
  double numbers are valid.
* Build: Compile with -Wfloat-equal.
* OpenGL: If OpenGL crashes during startup, write
  explicitly that there's something wrong with the
  computer, to emphasize that it's not a bug in
  Radium. (One of the most common cause of crashes
  is people using the very unstable Nouveau graphics
  card driver for Nvidia cards on Linux.)
* Build: Print source file name in green color.
* Build: Display compilation time for each file.
* Sequencer: Fix some minor issues when painting the
  sequencer and navigator bars.

  timing track under "Grid". Also adjust color.
* Swing:
  * Editor: Fix mouse cursor not changing shape to
    split-horizontal when cursor is above a place
    when it's possible to change width of track, and
    the next track has swing-text visible.
  * Editor: Fix undoing track swing.
  * Editor: Make backspace and alt+backspace work on
    track-swing if cursor is placed on a swing
    subtrack.
  * Editor: Let the tempo graph display tempo of
    current track. Relevant when using track swings.
  * Player: Fix extreme swing values, and probably
    extreme values of other tempo types as well,
    which could cause inaccurate timing,
    assertions, and perhaps crashes.
  * Editor: Fix line cursor jumping to the wrong line
    when stopping to play.
  * Editor: Fix track swings not being taken into account
    when starting and stopping to play
  * Editor: Take track-swing into account when
    displaying waveforms.
  * Sequencer: Make it optional whether to display
    track-swinging beats in editor tracks in editor
    seqblocks.
  * Sequencer: Make it optional whether to use
    block-swing when displaying beats in the
    timeline.
  * Sequencer: Make it optional whether to use
    block-swing for the grid.
* Editor: Don't set current track to track 0 when
  undoing/redoing and cursor was positioned on a
  timing track when creating the undo.
* Editor: Fix loosing BPM "glide" state when undoing,
  redoing, copying, pasting, and cutting.
* GUI: Fix accidentally pressing Ctrl+Z in the
  terminal after moving a pianonote outside the
  boundaries of a pianoroll, making it seem
  like Radium had frozen. What actually happened
  was that the mouse pointer was forcefully moved
  outside the the main Radium window.
* Build: Fix various null-dereference gcc 8 warnings.
* Build: Fix building using Debian Buster 10.2.
  (another sh -> bash fix).
* GUI: Fix memory corruption if first message
  displayed in the status bar is exactly 10
  characters long.
* Preferences: Add line/beat/bar opacity options to
  the "Editor"-tab.
* Editor: Fix subtracting 250 from bar and beat
  opacities before rendering.
* Editor: Fix dragging vertical scrollbar up and
  down. Broken in 5.9.96.
* Editor: Fix mouse wheel not always working in the
  editor.
* Manual: Various updates, mainly to the editor.
* API:
  * sendKeyEvent, optimizedBuild, gui_postKeyEvent,
    getNoteNum, hasSelectedNotes,
    showPianorollSelectionRectangle,
    hidePianorollSelectionRectangle, getAllNotes.



Changes 5.9.95 -> 5.9.96:
* Sequencer/Editor: When moving the sequencer cursor,
  only scroll the current editor block up or down if
  the sequencer cursor in the current seqtrack is
  above the current editor block.
* Manual: Update Swing page a little bit.
* Instruments: Add four FaustDev example instruments
  to the instrument menu. (Saw, Square, Sine, and
  Triangle.)
* Mixer strips: Fix new plugin automatically being
  set as the new current instrument after selecting
  "Insert plugin". That was not supposed to happen.
* Sampler instrument: Fix recording sample to disk
  when instrument name contains very special
  characters.
* Menus: Remove "Import XM" from the File menu. It is
  not working well enough to be put there.
* Import MOD: Ignore a couple of errors in order to
  load more MOD files.
* Import MOD: Hide the volume sliders from the track
  headers in the editor to makes the pan values more
  visible.
* Sequencer: Made it possible to configure the color
  of the current list entry border.
* Preferences: Remove a couple of unused colors.
* Sequencer: Fix color for current seqtrack border.
  (It used color for current mixer strip border
  instead.)
* Editor: Don't hardcode alpha value of the border of
  pianoroll note colors.



Changes 5.9.93 -> 5.9.95:
* Editor: Make sure the pianoroll of the first track
  is always visible after pressing Shift + left and
  the cursor ends up in one of the timing tracks.
* GUI: Add a "Visible" checkbox to the popup menus of
  the editor, the mixer, and the sequencer.
* Export soundfile: Make it impossible trying to
  create a FLAC file with 32 bits or float format
  since those are not supported by FLAC.
* Plugins: Just ignore loading plugin cache from disk
  if hash version on file is newer than is currently
  supported in the program.
* Plugins: Save plugin cache in hashmap V3 format so
  that older versions of Radium can still be used
  after scanning new plugins. (All versions of Radium
  between 5.9.90 and 5.9.93 will probably be marked
  unstable soon because of this.)
* Instruments: Fix undoing delete instrument. This
  operation was not always able to load the old
  audiofile for the sampler and fluidsynth instrument.
* Instruments: Fix instrument-list windows. Broken in
  5.9.90.
* Instruments: Fix VST plugins not always showing up
  in the popup menus before they are scanned.
* Editor: When moving notes in the piano roll, play
  new note if pitch is changed for an instruments
  that doesn't support changing the pitch of an
  already playing note.
* Windows: Fixed various problems if using non-ascii
  filenames and dirnames.
* Editor: Fix popup menu option for grabbing
  keybinding for "Rename instrument".
* Build: Add new build-type DEBUG_FAST, which is
  the same as DEBUG + O2/O3.
* VST/AU: Fix plugins not deleted properly when
  exiting.
* API:
  * New: editorIsVisible, showEditor, hideEditor,
    copyFilepathToClipboard, getClipboardFilepath,
    createIllegalFilepath, isIllegalFilepath,
    isLegalFilepath, getBase64FromFilepath,
    getFilepathFromBase64, putSettingsF,
    getSettingsF.
  * Use a custom "filepath" type to store filenames
    and dirnames.
  * Fix loadSong and saveAs sometimes causing
    autobackups and saving not working. Was only a
    problem when calling these functions from Python.
    


Changes 5.9.92 -> 5.9.93:
* Editor: Fix cut and paste range.



Changes 5.9.91 -> 5.9.92:
* Windows: Fix Jack if running in a directory with
  non-ascii characters.



Changes 5.9.90 -> 5.9.91:
* Menus: Remove lots of entries from "Editor View"
  that are also available in relevant popup menus.
* Build: Remove some -Werror flags from non-debug
  build.
* API/internal: Change type from int64_t to file_t
  for files.
* Internal: Let "instrument_t" be a struct to avoid
  accidentally mixing types.
* Mixer: Fix the "Configure color" option in the
  popup menu.

* Sampler instrument: Fix GUI graphics not updating
  immediately when dragging sliders if GUI was opened
  by the second time or later.

  config popup menu.
* Internal/GUI: Fix a bug in the raw mouse cycle
  handling in the internal widget system.
* FaustDev: Fix block diagrams not being drawn when
  using the LLVM backend. Bug introduced in 5.9.88.

  This might fix some freezing in the editor when
  it's redrawn.
* Sequencer: Add popup menu to the timing lane
  headers area.
* Keybindings: Fix grabbing keybinding when
  navigating popup menus with the keyboard.

Changes 5.9.86 -> 5.9.88:
* Startup: Make sure a proper error message is shown
  if the custom color configuration file is not
  valid.
* Windows: Fix editor text sometimes being garbled
  after startup. Bug has probably always been there,
  but hasn't been notable until very recently.
* Windows: Fix writing keybinding configuration to
  disk after grabbing keybinding.
* Internal: Use radium::Timer instead of QTimer for
  the main timer. Might lower idle CPU usage on Linux
  a little bit.
* Internal: Improve GC performance.
* Faust: Update faust to master-dev-2019-12-22
  (between V2.21.0 and 2.21.1). This update fixes
  interpreter backend not working properly for
  instruments using prerendered tables and other
  things ("os.osc" is the most prominent example not
  working before when used in an instrument).
* Keybindings: Make MOUSE_* and FOCUS_* qualifers
  OR-ed, and not AND-ed. AND-ing for these makes no
  sense since you can never have more than one widget
  focused, or the mouse to be directly above more
  than one widget at the same time.
* Keybindings: Add close button  to the keybinding
  grab gui.
* Keybindings: Add checkboxes for selecting focus for
  editor, mixer, and sequencer to the keybinding grab

  neither the "Jack Pilot" nor QjackCtl binaries
  included with jack works very well in 10.15.
* macOS: New workarounds to prevent Apple's OpenGL
  library from crashing when resizing (especially in
  10.14 and 10.15). Unfortunately, this causes a
  little bit of flickering when resizing, plus longer
  time to resize, but it's better than crashing.
* GUI: Fix crash when ensuring that a visible widget
  always has keyboard focus. The crash could for
  instance be triggered by pressing the tab key 4
  times in a row. Bug was introduced in 5.9.85.

  instrument widget.
* Editor: Fix pianoroll notes snapping to the next
  grid line instead of the current 50% of the time.
  Was usually not noticable except when trying to
  move the end position to the end of the block,
  which wasn't possible without pressing Ctrl.

    painting if "note_event_instrument_id" is set
    to -2.
  * Better error messages for various instrument
    functions.
  * Change "zoom" and "unzoom" to zoom / reset zoom
    the part (editor/mixer/sequencer) that has
    keyboard focus, not just the editor.
  * Removed: getTrackPanOnOffX1, getTrackPanOnOffY1,
    getTrackPanOnOffX2, getTrackPanOnOffY2,

  -inf dB or 0dB in various situations.
* Mixer strips: Fix error messages sometimes popping
  up in 5.9.64 when inserting / removing plugins.
* Mixer strips: Fix slow gfx update in 5.9.64 when
  editing bus send sliders.
* Mixer strips: Display automation/modulation values
  again for the bus send sliders, which disappeared
  in 5.9.64.
* Mixer strips: Include the "Effect:" section in the
  popup menu for bus send sliders.
* Instrument widget: Optimize graphical updates.
* API: Various improvements for debugging scheme
  code.



Changes 5.9.62 -> 5.9.64:
* Mixer: Fix bug not making it possible to show mixer
  strips for plugins.
* Metronome: Don't play extra sounds when playing
  block. Fix for bug introduced in 5.9.62.
* Editor: Avoid jumping cursor when stopping to play.
* Player: Fix selecting correct current seqblock and
  current block after stopping to play.
* Audio: Make Solo behave more generally. For
  instance, setting solo for a bus only makes the
  buses mute, not all instruments.
* Mixer/Sequencer: Display non-filled yellow border
  around solo buttons for implicitly soloed
  instruments.
* Jack: Don't crash, and don't show assertion window
  if saving state or setting port name when jack port
  could not be registered.
* About window: Include control port number.
* Message window: Fix quotations
* Audio Removed all bus on/off effects. Instead,
  audio connections are created / deleted. This
  improves CPU usage by around 5% and cleans up the
  code a bit.
* Mixer: Added "C2" button to show/hide bus
  connections. (Hidden by default.)
* Editor: Add "Edit" entries to the track popup menu.
* Editor: Make resize faster, and reduce chance of
  seing framed black editor while resizing.

* Editor: Fix minor graphical glitches when a block
  is played in more than one seqtrack.
* Sequencer: When setting cursor position when not
  playing, set current seqblock to the one under the
  cursor of the current seqtrack, if there is one.
* Sequencer: Fix single-click in the timeline to set
  cursor position (red cursor).
* Sequencer: When pressing Ctrl+C and no seqblocks
  are selected, copy the current seqblock and not the
  seqblock under mouse pointer.
* Sequencer: Remember current seqblock when changing
  seqtrack.
* Editor: Not necesarry to place the mouse cursor
  inside the editor when copying and pasting blocks.
* Init: Don't show assertion reporter window when a
  scheme function is redefined. It's enough showing
  the warning window.
* API:
  * New: showEditQuantitizeTab, showEditTransposeTab,
    showEditRandomizeTab, showEditVariousTab,
    canAudioConnect, setInstrumentIsImplicitlyMuted,
    instrumentIsImplicitlySoloed,
    setInstrumentIsImplicitlySoloed,
    atLeastOneInstrumentHasSolo
  * Removed instrumentIsBusDescendant.
  * Fix selectPrevPlaylistBlock and
    selectNextPlaylistBlock when playing song.
    Broken in 5.9.62.
  * Don't pretty-print backtrace code. Takes up
    too much space.

* Sequencer: Fix bar and beat numbers in the
  sequencer timeline.
* Edit: Functions to randomize octaves.
* Scheme: Improve backtrace display.
* Edit: Fix right-clicking a button to change
  keybinding for it. Fix for bug introduced in
  5.9.60.
* Sequencer: When changing current seqblock, also
  change current block if seqblock holds editor
  block.
* Sequencer: When changing current seqtrack, also
  change current seqblock.
* Sequencer: Make left arrow key select previous
  seqblock and right arrow key select next seqblock.
* Build: Updated S7.
* Sequencer: Remember current seqblock when
  undoing/redoing, and also save to disk.
* Playlist: Is visible during startup by default.
* Sequencer: Let delete key delete current seqblock.
* Sequencer: When current seqblock is deleted, let
  next seqblock be current seqblock, or previous if
  there is no next.
* Sequencer: Paint name of current block with a white
  pen instead of painting a blue border around the
  seqblocks.
* Playlist/Sequencer: Bind current playlist element
  and current seqblock.
* API:
  * New: selectPrevSeqblock, selectNextSeqblock
  * Update grid button graphics when calling
    setSequencerGridEnabled.
  * Add dynvec_t type, and convert most functions
    storing arrays in dyn_t to use dynvec_t instead.



Changes 5.9.60 -> 5.9.61:
* Build: Compile ladspa-plugins without debug symbols
  to lower startup time if realtime virus scanning is
  enabled.
* Windows: Update Qt to V5.12.3. (macOS: Qt was
  updated to V5.12.3 in Radium 5.9.60. Linux: Qt is
  still at V5.12.2.)
* Windows/Linux: Compile Radium with gcc 8.3.0.
  (Upgraded from gcc 7.4.0.)
* GUI: Only hardcode F11 to switch full screen for
  windows which takes care of keyboard events
  themselves. For instance the help windows.
* Linux: Fix undefined behavior when setting a window
  to not be full screen.

* Mixer: Add function "switch-solo-for-selected-instruments"
* Sequencer: Fix some minor graphical garbage in the
  lower-left buttons.
* GUI: Fix crash that sometimes happened when
  clicking slighly outside a popup menu entry.
  (Bug introduced in 5.9.60)
* Log: Log all clicks on popup menu entries.
* API: setSoloForInstruments, setMuteForInstruments,
  setBypassForInstruments,
  switchSoloForSelectedInstruments,
  switchMuteForSelectedInstruments (Lydkraft),
  switchBypassForSelectedInstruments (Lydkraft).



Changes 5.9.52 -> 5.9.60:
* Editor: Don't update graphics during playback if
  "enable_editor_rerendering_during_playback = false"
  is included in the config file.
* Editor: Let grid follow graphical line, not tracker
  line. I.e. don't ignore LZ when using grid.
* Keybindings: Let up/down key move select previous
  or next seqtrack when sequencer has keyboard focus.
* OSX: More workaround for graphics not updating
  after resizing editor.
* Windows: Fix paths being screwed up when directory
  separators are converted to backslashes. Might fix
  some Python issues.
* Manual: Various improvements.
* GUI: Improve keybinding display in the main menus,
  popup menus, and the edit tab
* Sequencer: Drag seqtrack number to change seqtrack
  order. (The numbers inside the circles) 
* Linux: When running Radium under gdb, close popup
  menu if it has been open for 40 seconds and kill
  Radium if a popup menu has been open for at least
  50 seconds. This to avoid freezing X if program
  crashes under gdb while a popup menu is open.
* New song: Make default color of the main pipe blue
* Sequencer: Rename the lower left buttons.
* Mixer: Add "1:3", "1:1", and "3:1: radio buttons to
  the main mixer header and to the mixer popup menus.
* GUI: Set all bus instrument colors to "Default Bus
  color" (a configurable color) when starting up.
* Sequencer: Introduce "Bus" seqtracks. Bus seqtracks
  are audio seqtracks that pipes input by default.
  The colors of seqtrack buses are also set to
  "Default Bus color".
* Audio: Add "Pipe input" option to audio seqtrack
  instruments.
* Sequencer: Minor optimization for the audio file
  player.
* Editor: Fix metronome not making any sounds between
  seqblocks in editor timing mode.
* Sequencer: Display slightly less erroneous bars
  and beats between seqblocks in the timeline when
  the duration of the last bar of the previous played
  block wasn't a full bar.
* Initialization: More messages during startup about
  what's happening.
* Editor: When creating new a note, pitch, fx,
  velocity, or tempo with mouse, always let that
  note/pitch/fx/velocity/tempo start at the
  beginning of the line the mouse cursor is
  placed in, not on the next line if mouse cursor was
  placed below half-way into the line. (blackhole89)
* Editor: Fix new piano-notes being rounded to the
  nearest note (whether it's up or down). Before,
  it was always round down to the nearest note.
* Audio: Fix audio meter graphical update when an
  instrument changes number of visible channels.
* GUI: Fix clicking radio buttons in popup menues
  when clicking the entry outside the circle.
* Sequencer: Double-click a marker to loop between
  that marker and the next.
* Editor: Show red border around current column
  inside the cursor (the color is configurable).
* Editor: Show border around current track. The
  border has the same color as the keyboard focus
  border color, and is also shown only if the editor
  has keyboard focus.
* Sequencer: Include last marker when calculating
  song duration.
* Sequencer: Use all leftmost space when there is
  only one seqtrack. (There is no current seqtrack
  border when there is only one seqtrack.)
* Internal: Update S7 scheme.
* Menus: Only display "Ctrl" when both left or
  right control is assigned to a command. Same for
  alt and shift.
* Menus: Automatically display several entries when
  more than one keybinding is assigned to a command.
* Startup: Fix keybindings sometimes not working on
  windows. At least I'm pretty sure it's working now.
* GUI: Speed up opening popup menues. (Content is
  cached now.)
* Playlist: Fix crashes that could happen when
  inserting audio file.
* Edit: Make sure all text is shown in the "Randomly
  delete notes" and the "Lightly shuffle pitches"
  sliders.
* Keybindings: Redefine almost all keybindings so
  that they only work when having relevant
  keyboard focus.
* GUI: Separate keyboard focus for the editor, the
  mixer, and the sequencer. Press Ctrl+F5, Ctrl+F7,
  and Ctrl+F8 to change keyboard focus between the
  editor, the mixer, and the sequencer.
* Internal: Display error message when there is an
  error while finding right keybinding code to
  execute when a key is pressed.
* Shut down: Fix crash iwhen program could't start
  up.
* Linux: Update URL to nvidia driver
* Sequencer: Add a "Copy filename to system
  clipboard" entry to the audio seqblock popup
  menu.
* Fluidsynth: Fix erroneously display of
  sample/bank/preset in the instrument GUI.
* Editor: Update tooltip for "Edit Lines" ("EL") in
  the bottom bar.
* Editor: Fix note not stopping to play when
  releasing computer keyboard key after adding a
  note.
* Editor: Fix note being played when adding notes and
  "Edit Lines" has a value larger than 0.
* Audio: Improve CPU usage of fading in and out.
* Audio: Improve CPU usage of the granulator a little
  bit.
* Editor: Make resizing look more professional by
  covering up some flickering. It's probably not
  possible to make perfect though, because of OpenGL.
* Audio: Minor optimization to the multicore
  scheduler.
* Load/Save: Remember last used directory when
  loading/saving song
* GUI: Fix a division by zero when rendering editor
  track header. Probably makes no difference in
  graphics, but might make it run faster.
* Audio: Add a little bit of release to the Click
  instruments to avoid noise when unpressing the
  click button in the bottom bar.
* Audio: Written new algorithm for smoothing delay.
  Should improve CPU usage significantly overall.
* FaustDev: Add support for the interpreter backend.
* FaustDev: Compile Radium with the option
  WITHOUT_LLVM_IN_FAUST_DEV to only include the
  interpreter backend. (Avoids linking with the
  LLVM libraries.)
* FaustDev: Make compilation faster.
* Build: Fix compiling with clang 8.0.
* API:
  * New: copyWtextToClipboard, getClipboardWtext,
    copyTextToClipboard, getClipboardText,
    gui_getSequencerFrameGui, setEditorKeyboardFocus,
    setMixerKeyboardFocus, setSequencerKeyboardFocus,
    gui_setLayoutStretch,
    gui_getVertRatioInMixerStrips,
    gui_setVertRatioInMixerStrips, addKeybinding,
    getKeybindingsFromCommand,
    instrumentIsSeqtrackBus.
  * Removed: getKeybindingFromCommand.
  * Renamed: setKeybinding -> addKeybindingToConfFile,
    removeKeybinding -> removeKeybindingFromConfFile.
  * Documentation: Remove erroneous comments for
    openFileForReading and readLineFromFile. These
    functions are implemented.
  * Add optional start and end arguments to
    setSeqLooping.
  * Add optional "is_bus" argument to appendSeqtrack
    and insertSeqtrack
  * gui_createMixerStrips ha as new optional argument
    "vert_ratio" (is 1/1 by default).
  * swapSeqtracks doesn't create undo anymore.



Changes 5.9.51 -> 5.9.52:
* OSX: Workaround for sequencer graphics not being
  updating in 10.14 when moving the "dragger" (i.e.
  the "=" button in the top left corner of the
  sequencer).
* Editor: Fix cursor line sometimes being placed in
  wrong position after resizing.
* OSX: Workaround for crash in Apple's OpenGL library
  that sometimes happened when starting up, and when
  resizing editor. (The workaround is to pause
  graphics rendering for a short while after
  resizing). This bug was especially noticable on
  macOS 10.14.
* Internal: Add compile time option to run OpenGL in
  the main thread instead of it's own thread. Didn't
  fix the OSX crashes though.
* Editor: Reduce flickering when resizing.
* Keybindings: Don't crash and don't show assertion
  reporter if there is something wrong with the
  keybinding configuration.
* Keybindings: Show error message in message window
  when pressing a key and the keybinding failed to
  run.
* OSX: Don't crash if trying to run Radium without
  first installing jack.



Changes 5.9.50 -> 5.9.51:
* Sequencer: Don't crash after selecting Cancel when
  asked for replacement of missing audio file.
* Sequencer: Don't accept replacement audio file if
  the base names of the two filenames differ. This is
  a quick right-before-the-release hack to avoid a
  crash that can happen if the two files have
  different lengths. Needs proper solution later.
* Song properties: Change the text "Send global swing
  tempo to plugins" to "Send global swing tempo to
  plugins and jack transport".
* Song properties: Change the text "Audio files" to
  "Audio files in Sample player and Fluidsynth".
* GUI: Increase default block saturation to 1.0
* GUI: Increase default instrument saturation
  to 0.67.
* GUI: Add options to set instrument saturation and
  brightness for the editor only. May want a less
  saturated background color in the editor.
* Internal: Include the samplereader and ratio tests
  into "make test".
* Internal: Fix "make test".
* Internal: Run "make test" in the build script for
  creating new releases. "make test" does catch the
  bug below, but running it wasn't automated.
* Internal: Fix crash when moving several seqblocks
  in some situations. The bug was general though, so
  it might have caused other problems as well. The
  bug was introduced in 5.9.48, so all releases
  between 5.9.48 and 5.9.51 will be marked unstable.
* Audio: Fix the problems with latency compensation
  in 5.9.50. The bug had actually always been there,
  but hopefully it had not been audible
  before 5.9.50.
* Load: Fix crash when loading old songs,
  approximately around 4.2.0 or older. Not sure when
  this bug was introduced.
* Audio: Some minor optimizations of CPU usage.
* API: getInstrumentBrightnessInEditor,
  setInstrumentBrightnessInEditor,
  getInstrumentSaturationInEditor,
  setInstrumentSaturationInEditor.



Changes 5.9.49 -> 5.9.50:
* Audio: Make internal block size configurable.
  CPU usage is reduced significantly when the
  internal block size is increased.
* Jack: Show error message if changing jack block
  size during runtime.
* Audio: Reorganized the audio engine in order to
  significantly reduce CPU usage when there's many
  sound objects.
* Audio: Remove the "Recalculate latency on the
  fly..." option since it is not necessary anymore.
* Editor: Don't move cursor when stopping to play
  block and jack transport is enabled. This fix also
  turns off the ability for another program to set
  current editor block and line when not playing.
* Audio: Share output buffers between instruments to
  decrease cache misses. Significantly reduces CPU
  usage when there's many instruments.
* Sampler instrument: Fix displaying empty waveforms
  in the editor (very rarely though) when automating
  pitch or stretch.
* API: Removed doAlwaysRunBuses, setAlwaysRunBuses



Changes 5.9.48 -> 5.9.49:
* System: Updated Qt to 5.12.2.
* GUI: Color tweaks.
* System: Add missing Qt5Webkit library for QT5
  build. (Teteros)
* Sample player: Move the "Granulate" checkbox to the
  top of the next column.
* Instrument: Adjust displaying ratio text in the
  compressor.



Changes 5.9.46 -> 5.9.48:
* Linux: Patch the included WebKit library so that it
  doesn't load browser plugins. Visiting the
  Wikipedia LFO page (linked to in the manual) could
  make Radium crash if user had installed a buggy
  plugin, or a plugin linking to Qt.
* Sequencer: When pressing Space while playing, just
  stop playing, and don't move cursor back. When
  pressing Space while NOT playing, first move cursor
  back to last place we started playing from, and
  then start playing.
* GUI: Remove the text "CPU:" from the bottom bar.
* GUI: In the bottom bar, make the status bar and
  the volume slider always have the same width.
* Editor: When edit is OFF, and we are playing notes
  on the computer keyboard, send the notes to the
  current instrument and not to the instrument for
  the current track.
* Instruments: For older songs (approx. a year), fix
  note duplicator values being set to default values
  if undoing Reset or Random. Also fixes A/B usage
  and possibly other things. These are more
  fixes for the old note duplicator Chance bug which
  unfortunately caused old songs to have wrong values
  in them.
* Init: Make sure custom initialization code (in
  keybindings.conf) doesn't run until program has
  started up. Program could crash during startup
  because of this.
* Playlist: Fix wrong content showing up when a
  different seqtrack was selected while playlist was
  hidden.
* Playlist: Fix selecting prev and next playlist
  block when playlist isn't visible.
* Instruments: Immediately remove "[m]" from
  instrument slider/checkbox text after removing
  a modulator from the effect.
* Preferences: Add sliders to control brightness and
  saturation for blocks/audiofiles colors and
  instrument colors.
* Instrument: Fix rare crash that could happen when
  creating new instrument.
* Sequencer: Fix rare crash that could happen when
  creating new seqtrack.
* Audio: Optimize checking if instrument can
  autosuspend.
* GUI: Make tab colors configurable.
* Metronome: Fix silent metronome when playing block
  in sequencer timing mode.
* Metronome: Fix stop notes not being sent out in
  sequencer timing mode.
* Metronome: Fix stop notes sometimes not being sent
  out when starting to play a new block in editor
  timing mode.
* Modular mixer: Draw autosuspended objects in a
  grayer color than before.
* Linux: Decrease CPU usage for VST plugin GUIs.
* Windows/OSX: Fix program sometimes hanging when
  exiting program after using a midi input or output
  device.
* API: getInstrumentBrightness,
  setInstrumentBrightness, getInstrumentSaturation,
  setInstrumentSaturation, getBlockBrightness,
  setBlockBrightness, getBlockSaturation,
  setBlockSaturation.



Changes 5.9.44 -> 5.9.46:
* Windows/VST: Add a "DPI" checkbox to the VST plugin
  header when DPI is not 96, i.e. when either the
  display is scaled, or a hiDPI monitor is used.
  When unchecking the DPI checkbox, the plugin GUI
  will be reopened with a DPI of 96 instead. This
  will both let Windows do the scaling (causing
  blury and larger graphics), and in some cases fix
  bugs caused by plugins not handling a
  non-standard DPI. You need Windows 10 for this
  to work.
* OpenGL: Remove startup warning that Radium hasn't
  supported high DPI display for a very long time.
  It's been a pretty long time now.
* Error message window: Position in the middle of the
  screen.
* Progress window: Add a minimize button in the upper
  right corner.
* Mixer: Don't update graphics for the modular mixer
  when it's not visible.
* Mixer strips: Fix note intencity circle only
  lighting up/down when the main mixer was visible.
* GUI: Turn off menu and combobox animation. Screwed
  up menus on osx when using Qt 5.12. (Think the
  menu animation actually brought back the same bug
  that caused me to upgrade Qt from 5.7 to 5.10.)
* Mixer: Fix error message sometimes popping up when
  showing popup menu.
* JUCE patch for Linux: Display ALSA MIDI client
  names as clientName + ": " + portName to avoid
  mixup for ports with the same port name belonging
  to different clients.
* JUCE patch for Linux: Make sure all ALSA MIDI
  connections and ALSA MIDI ports are publicly shown
  (for instance in the qjackctl patchbay). Not
  showing them only creates confusion.
* JUCE patch for Linux: Set realtime priority for the
  MIDI input thread.
* Build: Update Juce from 5.3.2 to 5.4.3.
* Linux: Don't read from configuration file when
  opening a native VST gui. (Race condition that
  could have caused various trouble.)
* Init: Fix 1-10 seconds freeze that sometimes
  happened during program startup.
* Windows/Sequencer: Fix displaying non-ascii
  characters in the audio file browser.
* OSX: Fix file requester not filtering out entries
  when loading/saving mod/midi/xm/rad.  
* OSX: Radium requires 10.12 or newer.
* Editor: When appending new block, let it have the
  same number of tracks and lines as the current
  block. (Same behavior as insert block.)
* Instruments: Include the pan and width effects in
  the wet signal by default. This can be changed in
  the song properties window. When loading older
  songs, pan and width is not included in the wet
  signal, since that could change the sound.
* Instruments: Disable the dry/wet slider when
  instrument is bypassed.
* API:
  * New functions: setIncludePanAndDryInWetSignal,
    includePanAndDryInWetSignal, appendBase64Strings.
  * Add optional argument "text_is_base64" to gui_drawText



Changes 5.9.43 -> 5.9.44:
* Editor: Add undo when selecting "Add automation to
  current editor track".
* Sequencer: Delete block when undoing "Replace With
  New Block".
* Sequencer: Less gradient background color.
* Modular mixer: Generate same color for all selected
  instruments when selecting "Generate new color".
* Linux: Don't show warning about MESA when using
  an AMD GFX card.
* Init: Initialize OpenGL much earlier in the
  startup. Could reduce the chance of crashing
  OpenGL during startup.
* Editor: Fix not playing notes twice when adding a
  note and "Play notes under the cursor when moving
  up or down" is enabled. This was supposedly fixed
  in 5.9.42, but wasn't.
* Editor: Turn off autorepeat when pressing left
  shift while adding notes and "Enable keyboard
  autorepeat when adding notes in the editor" is
  disabled.
* Instruments: Update slider text immediately when
  changing "Change value when pressing "random".
* Editor: Ensure cursor is visible when moving the
  horizontal scroll bar.



Changes 5.9.42 -> 5.9.43:
* Editor: Don't crash when changing on/off for a
  non-existent track.



Changes 5.9.41 -> 5.9.42:
* Fluisynth: Update URL to fluidsynth in the info
  window.
* Editor: Don't play notes twice when adding notes
  and "Play notes under the cursor when moving up or
  down" is enabled.
* Sequencer: Fix graphics rendering between the
  timing/marker lanes and the opmost visible
  seqtrack.
* MIDI instrument: Fix error message popping up when
  mouse is above a CC slider or above a note
  duplicator on/off button.
* Instrument widget: Fix wrong fonts in the note
  duplicator, for the instrument name input widget,
  and for the sample browser path.
* Sampler instrument: Fix modulators when loading
  songs saved before 5.9.41. Note that songs saved
  with 5.9.41 (and only that version) will require
  some editing if modulators had been assigned to
  effects in the sample player in that version of
  the program. (5.9.41 is marked as unstable now.)
* Instruments: Fix assertion window popping up when
  selecting "add automation to current editor track"
  and there was already an automation node for that
  effect at the current editor position.
* Instruments: Don't show assertion window when
  making states for the Faust Dev and Pd instruments.
* Sample instrument: Delete GUI when instrument is
  deleted.
* OSX: Show a different startup warning when running
  macOS 10.14. Radium has been tested on 10.14 now,
  but not much, and it sometimes crashes during
  startup.
* fix for prev. commit
* Sample player: Fix high CPU usage when the GUI is
  open.
* Audio meters: Ensure meters are really updated
  every frame. Earlier we updated every 20ms, which
  is more than the common 16.6ms update period.
* Audio meters: Changed the "CPU friendly" option
  in preferences to update every 3rd frame instead
  of every 2.4th frame. Probably looks better with a
  consistant refresh rate.
* Sampler instrument: Set default grain overlap value
  to 3.0 instead of 1.0.
* Sampler instrument: Allocate granulator instances
  from a common pool shared by all sampler
  instruments. This should both lower memory usage
  and CPU usage.
* Sampler instrument: Added a "fine stretch" slider
  in addition to the old "coarse stretc" slider. The
  coarse stretch slider went from -100 to 100 which
  was a bit hard to control.
* Sampler instrument: Added a "gran. volume" slider
  for doing volume compensation so that the level
  can be set to approximately the same when
  enabling/disabling granulation. Note that the
  default value is set to -6dB, so you need to
  manually set this value to 0.0dB after loading
  songs saved with Radium 5.9.41.
* Sampler instrument: Don't stretch waveform data in
  editor when granulation is disabled.
* Sampler instrument: Display stretch values between
  0.0 and 1.0 as "1.0/xxx" instead of "0.xx".
* Sampler instrument: Change scaling method when
  stretch is below 1.0. Now stretch spans with
  linear numerator values in the range 100/100 to
  1/100 instead of ranging linearly from 1.0 to
  0.01. Note that stretch automation will sound
  different for values below 1.0 for songs saved with
  Radium 5.9.41.
* Startup: Don't draw OpenGL until program is
  finished initializing. Fixes program sometimes
  freezing for a few seconds after startup.
* Startup: Show mixer strip for current instrument
  before swapping opengl for the first time.
* OSX/crashreporter: Only wait 5 seconds for the OSX
  diagnostic report file to be created.
* Progress window: Optimize performance.
* Build: Upgrade libatomic_ops from 7.4.12 to 7.4.14
* Build: Update BDWGC to 7.4.16. Contains an
  important fix for Windows if running 32 bit Radium
  in a 64 bit operating system.



Changes 5.9.39 -> 5.9.41:
* Sequencer: Use a gradient background color.
* Instruments: Fix bad bug when undoing/redoing note
  duplicator voice on/off. Fix for undo/redo and
  memory corruption. The bug was probably introduced
  during the last year.
* Sampler instrument: Added granulation.
  Visualization is displayed in the GUI window.
* Instruments: Save "Random" state by effect name and
  not by effect number. Prevents wrong values if
  loading an instrument that has changed the number
  of effects, or the effect order, since last time.
* Plugins: Show assertion window if saving effect
  value to hash table with an already used key.
* Editor: Let a bottom slider value of 0 mean that
  the height is set automatically. (In "GFX tweaks")
* Import MOD: More progress window messages.
* OpenGL: Remove some flickering when resizing.
* Editor: Add an "R" checkbox in the bottom left
  corner. This checkbox replaces the "tracker style"
  vs. "sequencer style" radio buttons in preferences.
* Editor: Made tracker-style recording the default
  mode.
* Sequencer: Improve statusbar messages in the

  "Navigate 4 menu rows up" entries
* Mixer: Show a note indicator led in the audio
  meters, similar to the ones in the modular mixer.

  to fit.
* Sequencer: Don't show error messages about illegal
  navigator handle values since it seems to happen

  cursor" option is enabled.
* Note duplicator: Show effect names and "(right
  click for options)" in the status bar for all
  fields when mouse is above a field.
* Editor: Fix wrong automation value sometimes (i.e.

* Instruments/Help: Add "Help" option to the bottom of
  the effect slider/checkbox popup menu.
* Sequencer: Fix race condition in all of automation
  and timing. Bug introduced in 5.9.30. This fixes
  wrong tempo values sometimes being read, wrong
  signature values sometimes being read, wrong
  automation values sometimes being read, wrong
  song tempo values sometimes being read, and possibly
  prevent crashes and strange behaviours. Wrong
  behaviours caused by this bug should have been
  rare though.

  insert or delete the expected number of lines when
  LZ is not 1. I.e. when LZ is 2, insert 1/2 line.
  If LZ is 1/2, insert 2 lines, and so forth.
* Editor: Fix cursor position after inserting or
  removing lines when LZ is not 1.

  red->green gradient color instead of the new
  grayish color that was hard to distinguish from
  the background.
* API
  * Change types of the "start" and "length" arguments
    for 'setInstrumentLoopData' from int to int64_t.

  top of seqtrack headers.
* Sequencer: Always draw the same bar numbers in the
  "bars and beats" lane.. E.g. don't sometimes draw bar

  in the first seqtrack to define tempo and rhythm,
  set tempo and rhythm in the new sequencer timing
  lanes. Select "sequencer timing" by right-clicking
  in the sequencer and select "Use sequencer timing".
* Metronome: Only play metronome ("Click") for timing
  generated by the first seqtrack.
* Instruments: Change the text "green lines" to "yellow

  value would change value instead, and other similar
  things, which was quite confusing.
* Sequencer: Don't show the resampler seqblock
  interface popup menu for editor seqblocks.
* Sequencer: Add "Recording options" entry to the
  audio seqtrack section

    to gui_scrollArea, gui_verticalScroll, and
    gui_horizontalScroll.



Changes 5.9.20 -> 5.9.21:
* Quantitize: Fix crash happening sometimes. Bug
  introduced in 5.9.8.
* Editor: Make changing pianonote end position
  frame-accurate.
* Editor: Make moving pianonote and changing pianonote
  start position frame-accurate.
* Editor/pianoroll: Fix assertion error sometimes
  popping up when trying to move note below end of
  block.
* S7: Build s7 with debug symbols.
* Sequencer: Name the automation entries ("Automation")
  in the popup menu.
* Editor/pianoroll: Make sure mouse pointer is placed
  in the middle of the newly created note in the x
  direction, and at the bottom of the newly created
  note in the y direction. This feels much more
  natural.
* Editor/pianoroll: Make it possible to move new
  notes upwards, not just change end note position.
* Sequencer: Fix assertion window popping up when
  creating automation and possibly other situations.
  Bug introduced in 5.9.19

  callback returns the wrong type.
* Soundfile saver: "Range" -> "Range in current block".
* Manual: Some minor fixes.
* Menus: Rename "Solo/Mute" to "Editor Solo/Mute".
* Menus: Moved "Turn off Solo for all instruments"
  from the Solo/Mute menu to the "Play menu".

* Menus: Rename "Block view" to "Editor View" and
  "Block edit" to "Editor Edit".
* Editor: Add "Muted" and "Soloed" to the track popup
  menu.
* GUI: Fix mixer strip for current instrument moving
  to the left side of the mixer when pressing the "W"
  button. Bug introduced in 5.9.15.
* GUI: Fix minimum height of the main window to grow
  and grow in size when pressing the "W" button in
  the mixer. Bug introduced in 5.9.15.
* Preferences: Options to let mixer window and
  sequencer window be independent windows. I.e. that
  they are not children of the main window, meaning
  that the main window can be put in front of the
  mixer or sequencer, the windows possibly get other
  bar buttons (depending on the OS and window
  manager), and so forth.
* Mouse: Fix gridding working the wrong way in the
  editor if the object we were moving wasn't
  already placed on the grid. Bug introduced
  around 5.9.5.
* Mouse: Make gridding frame-accurate.
* Editor: Fix moving note end in the note text
  subtrack.
* API: sequencerWindowIsChildOfMainWindow,
  setSequencerWindowIsChildOfMainWindow,

* Menus: Cleaned up a little bit. A lot more
  remains.
* Demo song: Remove all pauses and adjust system
  volume

  sometimes popping up when reaching the end of
  a seqblock after loading a song with samplerate
  mismatch (and possibly other situations).

  old songs where samplerates mismatch. (Most
  demo songs are saved in the older song format.)

  isSendingMidiInputToCurrentInstrument,
  setSendMidiInputToCurrentInstrument



Changes 5.9.18 -> 5.9.19:
* Linux: Build JUCE library optimized for SSE2 and
  SSE math. Should speed up audio processing, and
  possibly avoid denomals. (This is probably a
  regression, but I don't know when it happened.)
* Mixer: Don't stutter graphics when changing a
  "Main Pipe" send-slider value and other non-bus
  send-sliders values.
* Editor: Make MIDI FX enabled by default after
  creation. Bug introduced in 5.9.18.

  situations.
* Mouse: Make sure mouse pointer is always placed at
  correct position after erasing in the piano roll.
* API: Replaced getFxtextEffectNumFromX with

  seqblock to another seqblock and there isn't enough
  space between start of song and another seqblock
  already positioned in the new seqtrack.
* Editor: Show editor track popup menu when
  right-clicking below last line.
* Editor: Show editor track popup menu when
  right-clicking above line 0.
* Internal: Improve error message handling.
* Internal: Don't show the "stop/continue/etc." dialog
  when something went wrong. There was never any
  reason to press any other button than "Stop", and
  sometimes this dialog itself caused a lot more
  problems than the error.
* Internal: Don't treat mouse events in scheme when
  another scheme code is running.
* Editor: Fix crash/hang in 5.9.16 when moving a
  seqblock to another seqtrack in some rare
  situations.

  exception is thrown.
* GUI: Make keyboard navigation of popup menus behave
  same way as the main menus.
* GUI: Fix keyboard navigation in sub menus of popup
  menus.
* Editor: Right-clicking inside the note name subtrack
  will show the track popup menu, not switch between
  wide and narrow mode.
* Editor: Add a "wide/narrow mode" checkbox to the track
  popup menu.
* Add a "2 char note name" checkbox to the track popup
  menu. 
* Add help page for editor track FX.
* Options to enable/disable individual editor track FX.
* Mouse: Fix using Alt to move all nodes (and not Ctrl).
  Bug introduced in 5.9.16.
* Sequencer: Disable the "Granulation parameters" popup
  menu option when seqblock doesn't hold sample. Error
  messages were displayed if this option was selected.
* GUI: Automatically isplay keybinding for various popup
  menu entries.
* Menus: Add Seqblock functions to the "Clipboard" menu.
* Internal: Fix displaying function names in error
  handler.
* Internal: Prevent rare program freeze in error handler.

  button on a velocity. Could lock up the program when
  doing that.
* Editor: Don't create microtonal notes in the piano roll
  unless ctrl is pressed.
* API:
  * New functions: showFXTextHelpWindow, getFxEnabled,
    setFxEnabled, gui_isEnabled, setTrackNoteLength,
    getTrackNoteLength, trackNoteAreaWidthIsWide,
    setTrackNoteAreaWidth, getLastHoveredPopupMenuEntry,
    hoverPopupMenuEntry
  * Let changeTrackNoteLength take tracknum / blocknum /
    windownum as arguments instead of just windownum.
  * Add argument "throw_exception_if_not_found" to
    removeEffectMonitor



Changes 5.9.15 -> 5.9.16:
* Updated the manual somewhat.
* Sequencer: Update graphics after undoing or redoing
  fade length.
* Instrument widget: Don't create undo entry for the Solo
  button unless undo for solo is enabled in preferences.
* Audio: Add option to create undo entries when clicking
  a solo button.
* Sequencer: Fix error messages popping up after just
  clicking a seqblock, without moving it.
* Sequencer: Make keyboard modifiers consistent by
  changing the modifier for copying seqblock from Shift
  to Alt (macosx: Ctrl). This way, Shift can be used to
  move a seqblock vertically.
* Mouse: Use the same keyboard modifier to scroll
  horizontally as used to limit mouse movement in the
  x direction. (Windows/Linux: windows key. macOS: Alt)
* Mixer/Manual/Faust: When using the mouse scroll wheel
  to scroll vertically, scroll to the left when
  scrolling the mouse wheel up, and to the right
  when scrolling the mouse wheel down. Not the other
  way around.
* Sequencer: Draw seqtrack number in a separeate box,
  not as part of the seqtrack name.
* Sequencer: Fix having to press mouse button two
  times to make mouse button work right after
  changing seqtrack name.
* Update s7
* API: ensureCleanStateOutsideMouseCycle



Changes 5.9.12 -> 5.9.15:
* Sequencer: New GUI for the seqblock track on/off
  window (i.e. the editor seqblock GUI). It
  basically looks the same, but uses the internal
  widget system instead of the Qt widget system,
  so the code is cleaner and is more stable. The
  new GUI also have colorized buttons using the
  instrument colors.
* Internal: Improved scheme backtrace.
* Fix for editor tracks on/off GUI.
* Sequencer: Fix updating content of seqblock GUIs
  after undoing/redoing.
* Linux: Fix keyboard modifiers being resetted when
  reconfiguring widget contents.
* Sequencer: Add undo entries when editing editor
  track on/off in editor seqblock GUIs.
* Sequencer: Fix situations where seqblock GUI was
  closed automatically unnecessarily.

  up after an audio seqblock GUI had been
  automatically closed after a seqblock was
  deleted.
* Sequencer: Set sample name as window title for
  the audio seqblock GUI.
* Sequencer: Replaced granulator from sndlib with
  a custom made granulator. The new granulator uses
  less CPU (especially for realtime usage), and
  behaves a bit differently. The new granulator
  also provides a new "strict no jitter" option.
* Sequencer: Display correct dB value in the Gain
  slider in the audio seqblock GUI.
* Sequencer: Fix the "Normalize!" button in the
  audio seqblock GUI.

  when neither the editor nor the mixer were visible
  in the main window.
* Sequencer: Add a "W" button to the top left area.
  The "W" button move the sequencer into it's own
  window, similar to the "W" button in the mixer.
* Sequencer Add an "F" button next to the "W" button.
  The "F" button let the sequencer take up all space
  in the main window. The "F" button works the same
  way as the "Full" button in the instrument widget.
* Sequencer: Change seqtrack header button order from
  "H R M S" to "R M S H"
* Sequencer: Fix graphics update when releasing mouse
  button after selecting rectangle area.
* Sequencer: Start editing seqtrack name when pressing
  mouse button on the name, not when releasing the
  mouse button.
* GUI: Ensure code that is supposed to run when
  releasing a mouse button is always executed.
  (Workaround for Qt design flaw.)
* Sequencer: Extend the horizontal borders between
  seqtracks to begin at the leftmost part of the
  seqtrack header.
* Sequencer: Fix delete seqtrack automation when
  shift+rightclicking.
* Sequencer: Use SplitVCursor as mouse cursor shape for
  the dragger.
* Sequencer: Fix error messages popping up when undoing
  a split audio seqblock operation. Other things may
  have been fixed too.
* Crashreporter: Replace any occurence of the users
  user name with "$USERNAME" (literarily) to ensure
  some more anonymity.
* Crashreporter: Include all non-standard characters
  found in home path and program path.
* Crashreporter: Include both home path and program
  path.
* Crashreporter: Fix some crashreports from linux users
  and some assertion messages not being delivered to me
  by the server (turns out that exim4 will silently not
  deliver an email if at least one line is around 800
  characters long or more).
* API:
  * New functions: markSeqblockAvailable,
    unmarkSeqblockAvailable,
    setVerticalSplitMousePointer,
    setSequencerInWindow, showHideSequencerInWindow,
    showSequencer, hideSequencer, sequencerIsVisible,
    sequencerInWindow, gui_setName, gui_bottomBar,
    hideUpperPartOfMainWindow,
    showUpperPartOfMainWindow,
    upperPartOfMainWindowIsVisible,
    showHideUpperPartOfMainWindow,
    setSeqblockGrainStrictNoJitter,
    getSeqblockGrainStrictNoJitter, undoSeqblock,
    enableSchemeHistory, disableSchemeHistory.
  * deleteSeqblock: add optional argument
    'notify_listeners'.
  * deleteSeqblock: take seqblockid as
    argument instead of seqblocknum+seqtracknum.
  * Don't show error message if a
    seqblock-deleted callback have called
    directly, or triggered a call to,
    removeSeqblockDeletedCallback.
  * Let addSeqblockDeletedCallback and
    removeSeqblockDeletedCallback take
    callback as the only argument, plus
    automatically remove the callback if it
    returned false.


Changes 5.9.10 -> 5.9.12:
* Sequencer: Fix gfx garbage when moving first or last
  seqblock automation node.

* Sequencer: Scroll horizontally so that the cursor is
  placed 1/4 into the visible area, and not 1/2, when
  play cursor falls outside the visible area when playing.
* Main GUI: Fix jumpy graphics when drawing the main
  window lower tab names ("Edit" / "Instrument" /
  "Sequencer") while resizing.
* Sequencer: Paint play-cursor in navigator as well.
* Sequencer: The height of all seqtracks can now be
  taller than the height of the sequencer:
  * Option to set height of a seqtrack. (Use the
    new "H" button or the "Set size" entry in the popup
    menu. The default seqtrack height is wet to
    "2 rows".
  * Ways to scroll the sequencer vertically:  
    * Use the mouse scroll wheel while pointer is
      positioned in the seqtrack headers
    * In the seqblock parts of the sequencer, hold one
      of the Windows keys (OSX: Alt key) while scrolling
      the mouse wheel.
    * Move the navigator up or down.
* Sequencer: Include the seqtrack popup menu entries in
  the header popup menu.

  caused buggy behavior when trying to load a non-
  existent file.
* Crashreporter/Linux: Include desktop/window
  manager info into the report.
* Crashreporter: Include all environment variables
  containing "qt" into the report.
* Menus: Add "Test assertion reporter warning" and
  "Test assertion reporter error" entries to the
  Help -> Debugging menu.
* Linux: Assert during startup that neither of
  QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME, QT_QPA_PLATFORM, nor
  QT_PLUGIN_PATH are set.
* Linux:. Unset the QT_QPA_PLATFORM and QT_PLUGIN_PATH
  environment variables in the startup script. Perhaps
  this will fix some strange crashes reported by
  anonymous users via the crashreporter.
* Windows/crashreporter: Fix backtrace when program path
  contains non-ascii characters.
* Windows/sequencer: Fix editing seqblocks for audio
  files containing non-ascii characters.

  borders.
* Sequencer: Make it possible to select an automation node even
  when parts of the node is painted in the neighbouring seqtrack.
* Sequencer: Started implementing the concept of
  "Current seqblock".

  seqblock while the seqblock audio GUI is open.
* Sequencer: Fixed wrong seqblock sometimes being rendered as
  being under the mouse while the seqblock is moved by
  the user.
* Sequencer: Don't split audio files at grid by default when
  pressing the "S" key. If you want to split at grid, use the
  popup menu instead.
* Sequencer: Never split audio file if pressing Ctrl+S while
  the mouse pointer is inside the sequencer. Ctrl+S should
  always be for saving song.
* Sequencer: Double-clicking a seqblock opens the
  "enable/disable editor tracks" or the audio seqblock
  "settings" GUI.
* Sequencer: Moved various entries from the "Seqblock----"
  section to the "Editor seqblock---" section.
* Sequencer: Add pitch slider to the audio seqblock GUI. This
  is more convenient than to both change "speed" and "stretch".
* Sequencer: Display inverted value as seqblock speed. This
  should both feel more natural and be more convenient. E.g 2.0
  is double speed and 0.5 is half speed. In addition, if both
  speed and stretch have the same value, seqblock duration
  is the same as if both speed and stretch had been set to 1.0.
* Manual: Use the word "seqtrack" instead of
  "sequencer track".
* Manual: Document how to record audio.
* Manual: Updated information on how to add seqtracks.
* Manual: Document resetting automation (shift + alt +
  right mouse button).

  menu.
* Sequencer: Add "Move to a different seqtrack" to the seqtrack
  automation popup menu.
* Sequencer: Add "Cut automation", "Copy automation", and
  "Paste automation" to the seqtrack automation popup menu.
* Sequencer: Remove the "Remove (delete all nodes)" option from
  the seqtrack automation popup menu. Use "Cut automation"
  instead.
* Automation: Consistently use the word "node", not a mix of
  "node" and "break point".
* Sequencer: Fix player not always automatically stopping at song
  end when there is seqtrack automation (bug introduced maybe
  a few months ago).
* Editor: Fix track headers not being redrawn when clicking the
  undo/redo buttons in the bottom bar.
* API:
  * New functions: addSeqAutomation2, getMouseFx, getMs,
    getCurrSeqblockIdUnderMouse,  getSequencerGridType.
  * Throw assertion when it won't work to add callback to a GUI.
  * Fixed the return value of addSeqAutomation
  * Changed setCurrSeqblockUnderMouse, getSeqblockStretch,
    getSeqblockSpeed, getSeqblockStretchSpeed, and
    getSeqblockResampleRatio to take seqblockid as argument
    instead of seqblocknum+seqtracknum.
  * Add optional argument 'use_gfx_if_possible' to
    seqblockHoldsBlock, seqblockHoldsSample,
    getSeqblockStretchSpeed, and getSeqblockResampleRatio
  * Removed the "seqtracknum" argument from getSeqGriddedTime.
  * Let popupMenu return guinum
  * Only show the "Ok / Continue" error dialog if we are
    fairly certain it won't block user interaction, possibly
    making it impossible to continue using the program. If we
    are not certain, the message will be shown in the message
    window instead.



Changes 5.9.4 -> 5.9.5:
* Update S7.
* Sequencer: Fix assertion reporter popping up, and sometimes
  also crashes, when saving a song that was originally created

    minimizeEditorWindow
 


Changes 5.9.0 -> 5.9.4:
* Update S7 scheme interpreter.
* Sequencer: Make it faster to move and edit seqblocks with stretch
  or speed automation.
* Sequencer: Fix minor memory leak.
* Sequencer: New look for the interface for fade in/out, interior,
  speed, and stretch. The values themselves are also drawn on top
  of the seqblocks themselves.
* Sequencer: Redraw everything when grid type changes.
* Sequencer: Only repaint seqblocks holding current editor block
  when editor is repainted.
* Sequencer: Optimize redrawing when selecting seqblocks
  (i.e. the selection rectange).
* Editor/Sequencer: Don't update graphics when changing current
  instrument and neither the previous nor current current instrument
  is used in the current editor block.
* Sequencer: Make seqblock colors a little bit less lighter,
  more saturated, and less transparent.
* Sequencer: Fix popup menu for the stretch boxes sometimes being
  activated also after resetting stretch.
* Sequencer: Don't set seqblock under mouse as selected (i.e. a
  greenish color) when right-clicking it.
* Sequencer: Set a sensible maximum width of the interface handles.
  I.e. if a seqblock is 100000 pixels wide, the handles are not 25000
  pixels wide, as they were before.
* Sequencer: Optimized drawing a little bit.
* Manual: Document how to break grid while editing automation.
* Sequencer: Paint automation nodes in a less transparent color.
* Manual: Documented moving all automation nodes, plus some general
  improvements to the mouse section
* Automation: When pressing the Alt key (OSX: Ctrl key), all break
  points are moved. Goes for all automation editing in the editor
  and sequencer.
* Sequencer: Add "Reset" and "Add default value node" options to
  the seqtrack automation popup menu.
* Sequencer: Add "Remove (delete all break points)" option to popup
  menu for seqtrack automation.
* Sequencer: Fix slightly off navigator position when dragging the
  right handle.

* Load: Don't show message about having to change note duplicator
  values because of an earlier bug when loading any of the
  demo songs.
* Modular mixer: Zoom to / from mouse pointer position, not to
  the middle of the window.
* Sequencer: Make sure time at mouse pointer is still the same
  when zooming in/out using the scroll wheel. I.e. zoom towards
  the mouse, not towards the middle of the screen.
* Audio file recorder: Don't start recording if we failed to
  open file.
* Sequencer: Set default fadeout value for new audio files
  to 10ms. This value is configurable, and can also be
  turned off.

  (it could cause pops) if value was less than around 100ms,
  plug fix a general tiny lag in volume automation and fade in.
* Sequencer: Fix sample reader not providing the last frames of
  a sound file. Somewhere between 0 and 4096 frames were always
  skipped. This caused small pops if the sound file wasn't
  silent the last 85ms or so.
* Internal: Wait until sample recorder thread has shut down
  before exiting. Fixes Qt error message during shut down in
  debug mode, and possibly other things.
* Sequencer: Resampler ratio seqblock automation.
* Sequencer: Add left and rigth "speed" seqblock boxes, similar
  to the "stretch" boxes.
* Sequencer: Option to enable/disable seqblock automation
  to the node popup menu.
* Sequencer: Option to enable/disable a seqtrack automation.
* Quantitize: Fix "behavior if a note becomes too short after
  quantization". For some releases, the option "keep original
  length" was always used no matter what the option was set to.
* Mixer: Add "Connect to main pipe" entry to the top of the
  sound object popup menu if instrument has audio out and it
  isn't connected to anything. (Very often you want to connect
  this object to the main pipe.)
* Mixer: Rename "Paste sound object(s)" popup menu option to
  just "Paste".
* Mixer: Fix "Paste sound object(s)" popup menu option. It was
  usually not enabled even when there was sound object(s) in
  the clipboard.
* Editor: If cursor is placed on last line, jump to line 1 if
  pressing the End key.
* Editor: Never scroll to line 1 unless cursor is placed on last
  line. E.g. if block has 32 lines and cursor is placed on line
  16, scroll to line 31 and not line 1 if pressing page down.
* Player: Don't play current editor block when releasing left
  shift key if a mouse button is pressed since the left shift
  key was pressed.

  if the number of undos have changed since the left shift key was
  pressed.
* Sequencer: Properly extend seqblock automation length when
  seqblock length has been extended.
* Seqblock: Don"t obtain keyboard focus in the seqblock settings
  widget.
* Sequencer: Also reduce seqblock automation length if seqblock
  length has been reduced.
* Sequencer: Put back the "Volume automation" entry in the editor
  seqblock popup menu. By accident, it disappeared somewhere
  between 5.8.1 and 5.8.6
* Sequencer: Show current interior value (i.e. "|---" "---|") in
  realtime in the status bar when changing an interior value.
* API:
  * New functions: getSeqAutomationEnabled,
    setSeqAutomationEnabled, getSeqblockLeftSpeedX1,
    getSeqblockLeftSpeedY1, getSeqblockLeftSpeedX2,
    getSeqblockLeftSpeedY2, getSeqblockRightSpeedX1,

    getSeqblockStretchSpeed, getDefaultAudiofileFadeout,
    setDefaultAudiofileFadeout, getDefaultInstrumentEffect,
    getSeqblockInteriorStart, getSeqblockInteriorEnd,
    getSeqblockSelectedBox
  * Add optional argument "use_gfx_if_possible" to
    getSeqblockStartTime, getSeqblockEndTime,
    getSeqblockStretch, getSeqblockSpeed,
  * Fix backtrace in message window when exception is thrown
    in the C API.
  * Don't show assertion reporter when an illegal value
    is sent to setFxnode. Just throw normal API exception.

  button in the plugins tab.
* Preferences: Automatically look through directories when adding or
  removing a path in the plugins tab.

  the path when finished in the plugins tab. I.e. no need to press the
  "Add" button afterwards, which at least to me was confusing.
* Preferences: Must press the Return key for a manually added path to be
  added in the plugins tab. Earlier it was enough just to move the mouse
  around a little bit while writing.
* GUI: Don't display names of empty directories in the plugin selector
  popup menu.
* VST/AU: When using more than 30 seconds to search for plugin files, don't
  ask to stop searching in all paths, just stop searching in the current

  getMaxSeqblockSampleGain.



Changes 5.7.2 -> 5.7.4:
* VST/AU: Always store individual effect values in undo, file, and a/b.
  Fixes some misbehaving plugins (not sure whether the plugins are
  required to store the effect values in the state, but I would think so).
* VST: Add "C:/Program Files/VstPlugins", "C:/Program Files (x86)/VSTPlugins",
  "C:/Program Files/Common Files/VST3", and
  "C:/Program Files (x86)/Common Files/VST3" to the default VST paths.
* Sequencer: Add "Add automation to current editor track", "Add automation
  to current sequencer track", and add/remove modulator entries to the
  header popup menus.

    just the ALSA port name.
  * Run ALSA MIDI input thread with lowest realtime priority. Necessary
    to get accurate timing.
  * Always subscribe to ALSA MIDI ports. I.e. always make connected port
    names public.

  device sends 0x90 instead of 0x80 for note off.



Changes 5.7.0 -> 5.7.2:
* Sequencer: Option to rename seqblocks. For audio files, this will edit
  what is displayed in the sequencer and playlist (the file itself is not
  renamed). For editor blocks, this will edit the block name.
* Blocklist: Let Shift + right mouse button remove the audio file from
  the song and the playlist when clicking a sound file, not delete a block.
* Blocklist: Don't add blocks or samples when right-double clicking.

  A/B, unless the A/B change also changes sample.
* Fluidsynth instrument: Make A/B and undo/redo more efficient.
* Instruments and Mixer: Fix a really bad bug in the A/B system. Values
  loaded from A/B wasn"t stored on disk and in undo/redo. Not sure when
  this bug was introduced, but it was visible for the users since the
  effect sliders weren't positioned to the new values.
* VST/AU: Make undo/redo more efficient.
* VST/AU: Make changing effect values more efficient.
* Mixer: Make A/B more efficient.
* Mixer: Include plugin state information in A/B data.

  number of effects than the saved state.
* Instruments: Make changing A/B more efficient.
* VST/AU: Fix GUI position when opened in Linux.
* Mixer: Fix reset A/B for "g" and "h". Earlier, resetting "g" actually
  resetted "f", and resetting "h" actually resetted "g".
* Sequencer: Increase calculated song duration if loop end or punch end
  is placed after the end of the last seqblock.
* Sequencer: Fix blocklist not being updated when inserting new track.
* Sequencer: Disable the popup menu options "Replace with existing block"
  and "Replace with new block" when right-clicking in an audio file
  seqtrack.

* Audio recording: Automatically delete takes when undoing (redo still
  works).
* Audio recording: Never reset the "take" counter when autocreating
  filenames.
* Sequencer: Don't wrap lines when printing seqblock header names. I.e. if
  there is not space for all of "Name of seqblock" in the seqblock header,
  don't just select between "Name of" and "Name", but print as many
  characters as there is space for.
* Undo: Fix current redo data being deleted when right-clicking a sound
  object in the modular mixer and possibly other situations.
* Sequencer: Program requires a session to record files. If not, we
  would have to move the recorded audio files when user saves song, which
  is a bit messy.
* Sequencer: One button for each function in the bottom of the seqtrack
  headers instead of popup menus.
* Audio recording: Fix rare crash when stopping to record audio file.
* Audio recording: GUI to configure recording options. Right-click
  the "R" button.

  while being used. Instead, just show a normal window informing that
  the window could not be found anymore.
* GUI: Fix clicking checkbox not always responding when clicking too
  fast.
* Audio: Increase number of system input ports from 2 to 8.
* Autobackup: Don't make backup when recording audio files
* API: setSeqtrackUseCustomRecordingConfig,
  getSeqtrackUseCustomRecordingConfig, setSeqtrackRecordFromSystemInput,
  getSeqtrackRecordFromSystemInput, setSeqtrackRecordingMatrix,

* Sampler: Fix crash when sampler instrument is deleted.
* Internal: Some improvements to the memory validation system
  Prevent bugs such as the sampler instrument bug above from going
  into production again.
* Sequencer: Record audio (press the new "R" button in the seqtrack
  header).
* API: seqtrackIsRecording, setSeqtrackIsRecording


Changes 5.6.7 -> 5.6.9:
* Linux: Include the libfontconfig.so library file.
* Player: More finegrained locking and less locking when changing tempo
  and other things.
* Player: Fix rare tsan hit when changing block tempo multiplier.
* Editor: Don;t limit mouse movement to the visible vertical area when
  moving notes / velocities / pitches / automation / temponodes.
* Error message: Fix showing error message from non-main thread
  (sometimes happens when an error messages is generated by Qt.)
* Sequencer: Disable option to enable/disable the "Glide to next break
  point" option in the last node for automations.
* Windows: Don't use mouse delta values when the mouse hardware reports
  absolute coordinates. This fixes jumping mouse movement in virtual box
  (when mouse integration is turned off) and possibly if using mouse
  pads or other similar devices.
* Windows: Read delta mouse movement directly from the hardware
  (WM_INPUT). Fixes situations where it's not possible to set the
  mouse position from software. In addition, it's better for finetuning
  since we circumvent acceleration applied by the operating system.
* Mouse: Slightly change mouse pointer position when the pointer is
  getting close to any of the edges. This makes it possible to e.g.
  continue moving a seqblock even if there is no more screen space for
  the mouse pointer to move.
* Sequencer: Fix error message popping up when trying to delete song
  tempo node while mouse is not currently above a node.
* Sequencer: Automatically set current seqtrack when adding new
  seqblock.
* Sequencer: Only show audio files in the file requesters to load
  audio files.
* Sequencer: Don't change current seqtrack when deleting seqblock.
* Sequencer: Swap which end of the seqblock is changed when selecting
  "Reset stretch". The old behavior might have had some advantages, but
  it felt counterintuitive.
* Playlist: Don't start playing song when clicking on an audio file
  name in the playlist.
* Sequencer: Don't stop playing if playing block (not song) when setting
  new cursor position.
* Playlist: Remove rare memory corruption bug that could happen when
  clicking the up/down arrows in the playlist to swap audio files.
* Sequencer: Move seqblocks a little bit smoother.
* Fix minor memory leak in blocklist and playlist.
* For audio file seqtracks, display audio file names in the blocklist
  instead of blocks.
* Sequencer: Let first seqtrack have the name "Main seqtrack" in
  new songs.
* Sequencer: Differenciate between audio file seqtrack and block
  seqtrack. An audio file can not be placed in a block seqtrack and
  vice versa. Later (not implemented yet), this makes it possible to
  implement seqtrack volume and solo/mute work for blocks without
  making too much interface confusion.
* Sequencer: Faster graphics when moving single seqblock.
* Sequencer: Fix update of mouse pointer shape in the seqtrack headers.
* Sequencer: Fix setting current seqtrack when clicking on the vertical
  audio meter.
* Sequencer: Numerate seqtrack headers.
* Sequencer: Add "Display bars and beats" checkbox to the popup menus.
* API:
  * Rename selectSeqtrack to setCurrSeqtrack.
  * Add a "for_audiofiles" argument to appendSeqtrack and
    insertSeqtrack.
  * New functions: seqtrackForAudiofiles, setSeqtrackName,
    getSeqtrackName, getAudiofilePostfixes, addAudiofile,
    moveAbsMousePointer, getDeltaMouseX, getDeltaMouseY,
    hasDeltaMouse, canMovePointer, getGlobalMousePointerX,
    getGlobalMousePointerY, getAbsMousePointerX, getAbsMousePointerY,
    getScreenWidth, getScreenHeight.


Changes 5.6.5 -> 5.6.7:
* GUI: Prevent crash in some rare situations when displaying an error
  message from a resize event. (Workaround for QTBUG-64375)
* Sequencer: Always change current seqtrack when clicking anywhere
  inside a seqtrack header.
* Sequencer: Automatically set current instrument to the seqtrack
  instrument when changing current seqtrack.
* Sequencer: When moving a seqblock to a new seqtrack, automatically
  set the new seqtrack as the current seqtrack.
* Sequencer: Don't show error message if trying to delete seqtrack and
  there is only one seqtrack. Instead, just silently ignore
  the operation.
* Sequencer: Optimize when to update graphics. (i.e. faster graphics).
* Mouse: Don't repaint editor and sequencer unnecessarily when moving
  the mouse pointer.
* Playlist: Show seqblock time in realtime when a seqblock is moved.
  This is a fix for a regression introduced maybe a few months ago.
* Sequencer: Paint all song tempo automation graphics when zooming in.
* Sequencer: Some minor optimization of sequencer automation rendering.
* Peak files: Peak files are now 50% smaller and uses 50% less memory
  in the program.
* Mixer strips: Fix graphics update when current instrument is changed.
* Sequencer: Various bug fixes and minor improvements.
* Sequencer: Draw a green border around current seqtrack, similar to
  how current instrument is shown in the mixer.
* Sequencer: Add "Song tempo automation visible" checkbox to the
  timeline popup menu, and replace "Hide song tempo automation" with
  "Song tempo automation visible" in the song tempo automation
  popup menu.
* Sequencer: Display instrument for seqtrack pointed to by mouse at
  the top in the "New automation" popup menu.
* Song: Calculate song length from start to the last automation node,
  not the last seqblock. This change also fixes a bug where
  automation nodes could be forced to be placed before a previous
  node when song length was shortened.
* Sequencer: Allow automation nodes to be placed after song length.
* Build: Move unpacking of s7.tar.gz from bin/packages/build.sh
  to Makefile.qt, plus automatically unpack if there is a
  newer version.
* GUI: Wait 5 seconds before trying again if a mouse/resize/paint
  callback fails. This to avoid debug message bonanza if something
  goes wrong.
* Sequencer: Redo seqtrack header GUIs. Much simpler and faster now.
* Sequencer: Don't start/stop playing twice when using scroll wheel to
  start/stop playing if the mouse cursor is placed in the
  sequencer timeline.
* Editor: Avoid a couple of floating point divide by zero errors
  when the height of the editor is very small.
* Build: Trying to fix find_moc_and_uic_paths.sh for Ubuntu.
* Build: Fix VST include path. Steinberg changed the directory
  structure again.
* Build: Upgrade s7 to latest version.
* GUI: Faster to delete widgets.
* Windows: Don't show error message about unable to find jack process
  command line arguments (not important for users to know).
* Editor: Set the default value of "F" (editor follows play cursor)
  to false.
* GUI: Remove the thin black line that can sometimes be seen between
  the channels in the vertical audio meters.
* GUI: Optimize rendering of audio meters and other widgets that paint
  all pixels (optimization by not filling the background first).
* API: Another fix for memory corruption (and strange scheme error
  messages) when an exception is thrown in scheme code called from
  a Qt event.
* GUI: Vertical audio meter rendering tweaks.
* GUI: Optimize vertical audio meter rendering, especially for widgets
  containing more than one audio meter.
* GUI: Don't paint background color of various widgets unnecessarily
  (bug fix). May speed up some things notably.
* Message window: Make sure error messages are properly shown also if
  they contain text that could be interpreted as html.
* Build: Support gcc 8.
* Sequencer: Fix possible sound glitches that could happen when moving
  seqblocks.
* MIDI: Use a lot less CPU when recording.
* API: gui_setClipRect, gui_cancelClipRect, gui_addVerticalAudioMeter,
  gui_removeVerticalAudioMeter, setPaintOpacity,
  gui_areaNeedsPainting, gui_dontAutofillBackground,
  gui_removeAllVerticalAudioMeters, removeStatusbarText


Changes 5.6.4 -> 5.6.5:
* Demo songs: Romance by Nikos Levantis.
* Editor: Incrase distance between peaks when displaying waveforms.
  This both looks better (although arguably) and uses less CPU.
* MIDI: Display notes in realtime as they are recorded when
  recording notes in sequencer mode.
* Audio meters: Don't show wrong meter values when audio meters
  are resized.
* GUI: Don't set mininum height of the editor to 400 pixels.
* Internal: Fix memory corruptions that could happen if a scheme
  exception is thrown in code called by a Qt event.
* Sequencer: Make it possible to change sequencer height by
  dragging the area above the seqtrack headers. This one is easier
  to use than the already existing drag handler.
* Reduce time Radium uses to exit.
* Editor: Don't re-calculate peak data unnecessarily for looping
  samples. Fixes stalling when setting block multiplier very low.
* Menus: Add "Suggest new feature" to the Help menu.
* API:
  * Fix a couple of bugs in gui_update and gui_getBackgroundColor
  * Make gui_update take double as arguments instead of ints, and
    automatically floor down / ceil up values so that the caller
    doesn't have care about Qt's mix of integers and floats in
    their widget system.
  * New functions: gui_getSplitterSizes, gui_setSplitterSizes.


Changes 5.6.3 -> 5.6.4:
* Sequencer: Avoid silent audio when playing an audio file that
  has fade-out, but no fade-in or envelope, the second time the
  audio file is played.
* Sequencer: When starting to play audio file, avoid starting
  to smoothly gliding between the volume it was set to last
  time the file was played to the volume it is supposed to play.
  (This smoothing transition only lasts around 1.5ms though)
* Instrument list: Fix opening the instrument list window.


Changes 5.6.2 -> 5.6.3:
* Sequencer: Track headers with name, volume sliders, and mute/solo
  buttons.
* Sequencer: Buttons to add, remove, and append seqtrack. Faster
  than using the popup menu.
* Instruments: Let default instrument colors be more colorful.
* Sequencer: Fix various bugs when playing samples.
* Sequencer: Avoid assertion hit about not finding sample.
* Sequencer: Fix some minor paint bugs.
* Sequencer: Improve general rendering performance.
* Sequencer: Draw sample waveforms using less points. Looks better
  and uses less CPU.
* Scheduler: Trying to track down rare assertion reports when a VST
  plugin sends out midi signals.


Changes 5.6.1 -> 5.6.2:
* Sequencer: Don't create undo when a Seqtrack instrument is
  automatically created. This operation can't be undone so
  we previously got an error message when trying to undo.
* Sequencer: Don't crash when an audio file is placed after an
  editor block containing a note continuing to play after the block
  has ended.
* Sequencer: Options to automatically generate new colors for editor
  block and audio samples.
* Mixer: Options to generate new random color for instruments.
* Sequencer: Halfly use the seqtrack instrument color as background
  color in the seqtracks, and make the default sequencer background
  color a little bit more greenish.
* API: generateNewColor


Changes 5.6.0 -> 5.6.1:
* Sequencer: Fix possible xruns when deleting sequencer block.
* Sequencer: Fix peak memory not released when removing audio file.
* Sequencer: Fix strange things that could happen if deleting audio
  file immediately after creating it.
* Sequencer: Fix buggy behaviour in peak rendering if loading
  songs with lots of audio files (several thousands).
* Player: Fix changing block tempo multiplier while playing song.
* Sampler: Fix peak rendering bug when zooming in a lot.


Changes 5.5.9 -> 5.6.0:
* Editor: Make it possible to delete last track.
* Playlist: Fix various bugs that could happen when pressing the
  arrow up or arrow down buttons in the bottom of the playlist.
* Sequencer: Remove lots of unused/dead/unnecessary code left from
  recent refactorings. Might speed up some things.
* API: Removed the following functions: getSeqblockGfxStartTime,
  getSeqblockGfxEndTime, positionSeqblock, positionSeqblockGfx,
  moveSeqblock, moveSeqblockGfx, getSeqblockStretchGfx,
  getSeqblockInteriorStartGfx, getSeqblockInteriorEndGfx.



Changes 5.5.8 -> 5.5.9:
* Load: Don't adjust for block length samplerate mismatch twice. This
  bug caused strange bugs when loading a song saved with a different
  jack samplerate, and it could be very notable if you didn't run
  jack with a samplerate of 48000 as the samplerate of the default
  song would mismatch.


Changes 5.5.7 -> 5.5.8:
* Sequencer: Add undo when changing interior start or end values.
* Sequencer: Fix loading/undoing/redoing an audio file sequencer
  block which has non-default interior start or end values and
  no stretch.
* Menus: Add "Report bug" entry to the Help menu.
* Sequencer: Make sure navigator bar is tall enough to show all
  information when there are many seqtracks.
* Sequencer: Don't show error message when trying to set an
  interior start value of an audio sample before the start of
  a song.
* Sequencer: Fix various issues when deleting a seqtrack with audio
  files.
* Sequencer: Fix so that it doesn't become impossible to move the
  right sequencer navigator handle if it had been moved as
  far left as possible. Before, the only way out of this situations
  was to zoom out using the mouse wheel.
* Peak files: Read peak files in a separate thread. Reading peak
  files of very long samples can take a little bit of time. This
  was especially notable when loading song.
* Peak files: DO re-generate peak file after failing to read it,
  and DON'T re-generate peak file after successfully reading it.
  (Program did the opposite.)
* Sequencer: Don't show error message happening when zooming out
  a lot and trying to move left stretch value before song start.
* Sequencer: Show correct number of audio meter channels for the
  Seqtrack instruments after loading song.
* Sequencer: Fix selection rectangle when editor is not visible.
* Sequencer: Fix Audio file split using the S key when editor is not
  visible.
* Sample player: Update current directory of browser when an audio
  file has been drag-dropped.
* Editor: Let RIGHT_ALT+U and RIGHT_ALT+D transpose all notes in a
  chord if the cursor is placed in the note subtrack, not just the
  first note of the chord.
* Editor: Let RIGHT_ALT+LEFT and RIGHT_ALT+RIGHT change velocity of
  all notes in a chord if the cursor is placed in the note subtrack,
  not just the first note of the chord.
* Editor: Let RIGHT_ALT+U and RIGHT_ALT+D transpose ranged notes if
  cursor is placed inside a range, similar to RIGHT_ALT+LEFT
  and RIGHT_ALT+RIGHT for changing velocity.
* Editor: When using polyphonic tracks and the cursor is placed in
  a velocity subtrack (and not in the note subtrack), the function to
  transpose single notes (RIGHT_ALT+U/D), and the function to change
  velocity (RIGHT_ALT+LEFT/RIGHT), will operate on the note in the
  current velocity subtrack and not the note in the first velocity
  subtrack.
* Sequencer: Always hide grid graphics when releasing mouse button.
* Sequencer: Remove the text "shape" from the fade shape popup menus.
* Mixer: Fix audio meter graphic update. (Some dirty graphics could
  sometimes be seen in 5.5.6 and 5.5.7.)



Changes 5.5.6 -> 5.5.7:
* Sequencer: Fix possible strange graphics and crashes when zooming
  in a lot.
* GUI: Fix popup menu style in Windows and macOS. The style changed
  in 5.5.6. Now it's back to normal.
* Audio: Fix rare bugs related to the sequencer that could happen
  when creating new instruments.
* Sequencer: Fix semi-rare crashes and strange behaviors that
  could happen when moving audio files in some situations.
* Internal: Fix some minor thread sanitizer hits.

* GUI: Fix a memory corruption bug in asynchronous popup menus.
* Mixer: Don't display "[disabled]" for the "Show GUI" option
  in the mixer strip popup menu.
* Sequencer: Configurable fade in and fade out shapes. Radium
  offers the same fade shapes as in Ardour: Linear,
  Constant Power, Symmetric, Slow, and Fast. The implementation
  is also based on code from Ardour.
  Manual: http://manual.ardour.org/editing-and-arranging/create-region-fades-and-crossfades/
* Scheduler: Add an assertion to try tracking down a rare
  assertion hit.
* Audio meters: Add option to update audio meter graphics every
  other frame instead of each frame. This seems to reduce
  editor stutter on some computers when the CPU is buzy.
* Audio meters: Only update dirty graphics. This seems
  to reduce editor stutter significantly on some computers
  when the CPU is buzy.
* Editor: Support high DPI displays. I.e. all available space
  is used, not just one quarter of it. Made in cooperation with
  Jarrad Hope. Tested on Linux (KDE) and macOS (retina display).
* Crashreporter/Linux: Inform whether it's the official binary
  or a custom build.
* Sequencer: Don't crash if adding audio file after manually
  deleting the seqtrack plugin.
* Seqtrack plugin: Fix whether it can deleted or not. Previously
  it could only be deleted when it was not safe to delete it,
  and vice versa
* API: useCPUFriendlyAudiometerUpdates,
  setUseCPUFriendlyAudiometerUpdates, getFadeShapes,
  getSeqblockFadeShape, setSeqblockFadeShape,
  getFadeShapeIconFilename.



Changes 5.5.2 -> 5.5.4:
* Player: Don't switch current instrument when starting to
  play from the beginning of a sequencer or range loop

  the last used sequencer block is displayed at top, and
  so forth.
* Sequencer: Smooth the volume+fade values before applying to
  audio files.
* Sequencer: Avoid the "interior-end value is larger than the
  default block duration" error sometimes popping up due to
  floating point rounding errors.
* Sequencer: Made audio file background halfly transparent,
  and paint background halfly in the same color as the
  audio file.
* Sequencer: Auto-fade in/out audio files when overlapping.
* Sequencer: Improve sequencer block auto-swap performance.
* Sequencer: Don't auto-swap audio files with other sequencer
  blocks.
* Sequencer: Don't show error message after undoing appending
  track without moving the mouse.
* Disk: Make it safer to save files.
* Build: Fix finding qt tools when uic-qt5/moc-qt5/qmake-qt5
  doesn't exist.
* Sequencer: Option to split audiofiles. Press the S key, or use
  the popup menu.
* Sequencer: Remove "technology preview" note/warning when
  inserting audio files. Hopefully it's stable enough for
  usage now.

* Load: Fix memory leak when loading song. (Fix for known bug
  introduced in 5.5.1.)
* Sequencer: Paint envelope before start and after end with
  a lower opacity.
* Sequencer: Only paint envelope before start and after end if
  mouse pointer is above it.
* Sequencer: Faster to change interior start and end values in
  audio files.
* Sequencer: Cache peak data so we don't have to read peak files
  from disk as often.

* Windows: Remove the "Always on top" option for plugins since
  it made no sense to disable it on that platform.
* VST: Bind native GUI to the window it was opened from. On
  Windows, this means that the GUI will be put in front of the
  window you would expect it to be put in front of, and not a
  random window, which was the case in 5.4.8.
* Windows: Fix opening VST GUI in the modular mixer.



Changes 5.4.7 -> 5.4.8:
* GUI: Don't start new windows in "Window Stays On Top" mode
  since these windows will cover VST GUIs. Also remove
  the Qt::Tool flag on Windows since it's not needed on that
  platform to make windows stay on top of the main window.
* Windows: Partly fix always-on-top VST GUIs. They will stay
  on top of the main window and the last opened currently
  visible window, but not on top of other windows.

Changes 4.9.10 -> 4.9.12:
* Documenation: Move things from the help menu into the
  documentation portal.
* Gui: More work to improve issues related to window hierarchy.
* Windows32: Fix instrument name displayed as "(null)" in
  the progress window during loading. Lots of related bugs
  fixed as well that could have caused bugs on all platforms.
* GUI: Fix the "hide" button not always working in the message
  log window when running a modal dialog.
* GUI: Fix a possible crash when parent of message gui is closed.
* Audio: Scan plugin in separate process. A buggy plugin won't
  crash radium anymore when scanning a buggy plugin (at least
  not normally).
* Plugin Manager: Fix bug that made scanning not always work
  quite correctly plus that it caused a "Gui #xxx closed and
  can not be used" error message.
* Editor: Fix the "invert pitch" function.
* Html viewer: Let Alt+left open previous page, Alt+right open
  next page, F5 reload, and Ctrl+R reload
* Documentation: Created a "help portal" with some inital
  content.
* Documentation: Updated keybindings.help.
* Edit: Add keybinding tool tips to the quantization buttons
  (range/track/block).
* Edit: Show message about missing range when trying to run
  a function that operate on ranges.
* Keybindings: Use Right Shift instead of Left Shift to
  transpose note one octave up or down.
* Keybindings: Use the 7 key to expand range and block.
* Edit: Removed "Under construction" and the "More" tab from
  the main window tabs. Although it's still under construction,
  it doesn"t look so frail anymore.
* Edit: Add new functions to randomize pitches and velocities.
* Edit: Add buttons for expand/shrink pitch, expand/shrink
  lines, invert pitch intervals, reverse notes, glissando,
  and creating polyphonic track.
* Edit: Brushed up the "Transpose" tab (GUI tweaks + write
  keybindings on the buttons).
* API/GUI: Let WebView get keyboard focus.
* API/GUI: Let standalone windows get keyboard focus when
  opened.
* Editor: Fix crash/freeze when using the glissando function
  on microtonal notes.
* Player: Don't schedule notes that have negative pitch values.
  (Negative pitch values can happen when using the note
  duplicator.)
* Render: Don't crash if trying to render a note value outside
  legal range.
* Fix error messages not showing when keybinding or menu
  configuration files couldn't be parsed..
* Fix error messages not showing when import XM failed, import
  MOD failed, and when import MIDI file failed.
* Preferences: Made the play cursor type options clearer.
* Jack Transport: Fix starting to play from a new position.
  Earlier the program started to play at the current position
  instead since we didn't wait for Jack to finish moving the
  cursor.
* Audio: Make sure last value in a sequencer automation
  is sent out. This bug was especially notable if the
  second-last node was non-gliding.
* Audio: Send correct init-song effect values when a node
  is non-glide.
* Audio: Send correct automation values when starting to
  play in the middle of a song. I.e. the effect values that
  the instruments would have had if starting to play from
  the beginning.
* API/setPitch: Dont allow higher pitch values than 127.
* API: gui_setToolTip, getKeyboardBindings,
  getKeyboardBinding, getQualifierName.



Changes 4.9.9 -> 4.9.10:
* Mixer: Update volume slider in modular mixer when
  volume was changed via MIDI learn.
* Mixer: Fix error message showing up when using an
  instrument without inputs or outputs.
* Audio: Add undo when editing plugin from a native GUI.



Changes 4.9.8 -> 4.9.9:
* Gui: Fix strange behaviors caused by keyboard events
  not used by Radium being sent back to Qt.
* Audio: Fix the XI instrument loader, which could have
  failed now and then, depending on the mood of the C
  compiler. This might, or might not, have been a problem
  in some past releases. In technical fairness, it should
  have failed in 50% of the releases, but I can't recollect
  that it has ever happened. It fails in gcc 7 though.
* Audio: When playing a song from the beginning, all
  effects in all audio instrument are reset to the state it
  had before new values were set by automation.
  (MIDI instruments have always done this. I've forgotten
  to implement it for audio instruments, until now.)
* GUI: Stop drawing the automation values in the sliders
  when setting a new value manualy. This way we always
  know the current value of an effect by looking at the
  slider: If the automation value is painted, the
  automation value is the current value, and if not, the
  slider value is the current value.
* Editor: Tweak bottom bar and reltempo positions.
* Build: Compile with "-no-strict-aliasing" since there is
  lots of code that I think could break without it.
* Audio: Fix bug that caused values set by automation to be
  saved to disk.
* Audio: Always set correct volume when enabling any of the
  following effects: Volume In, Volume, Pan, Dry/Wet.
  Earlier, wrong effect was set if automation had changed
  the values while the effect was disabled.
* Audio: Change mute into muting "Volume In" instead of
  "Volume" when the sound object doesn't have any output
  channels.
* Editor: Create undo when pressing return to add or edit
  notes and pitches.
* Menus: Don't start to navigate the main menus after
  pressing e.g. Left Alt + X. (The main menus should only
  pop up if pressing the Left Alt key alone.)
* GUI: Fix strange focus behavior when using combo boxes.
  (There are lots of combo boxes in the MIDI instrument
  widget)
* Menus: Fix keyboard focus after pressing the Escape key to
  close the main menus.
* Mixer: Workaround for a Qt bug causing mouse click not to
  work right after a custom exec have been triggered by
  pressing the mouse button, for instance after trying to
  delete a bus.
* GUI: More fixes to make sure things are repainted when
  running a custom exec, at least when it's safe to do so.
* Log window: Make it possible to click html links.
* Sequencer: Only repaint the sequencer track the node
  belongs to, not all tracks.
* GUI: Wider borders and wider space between widgets in the
  async message dialog.
* Internal: Reorganize code to better handle synchronized
  windows popping up at inconvenient times.
* Editor: Render pianoroll of the rightmost visible track even
  when the note lane isn't visible.
* Editor: Fix block tempo multiplier slider sometimes drawn
  with the wrong colors.
* Editor: Don't change current track when mouse pointer is
  outside the editor.
* Editor: Fix general flickering in the non-opengl parts. (Bug
  introduced a couple of releases ago.)
* GUI: Don't repaint everything when pressing the up or down
  key. (One of many situations where it is not necessary to
  repaint.)
* Sequencer: Turn off repainting-every-5-seconds-just-in-case
  hack. Not necessary anymore.
* GUI: More work to avoid widgets not being repainted when
  running a custom exec.
* Editor: Fix instrument names not always being displayed
  completely in the track headers when the text is getting
  closer to the right edge of the editor.
* Sequencer: Only repaint when necesessary when moving the
  mouse cursor in the editor or the sequencer.
* Mixer strips: Tweak volume requester gfx.
* Mixer strips: Display "0.0" instead of "-.0.0" in the volume
  display.
* GUI: Don't hide tracker headers, block tempo slider, and so
  forth, when running custom exec.
* Mixer strips: Write "New volume for ... (now ...dB):" in the
  requester when clicking the volume text. Earlier, the
  requester could have been confusing, especially if opened
  because the user clicked randomly in the mixer.
* GUI: More work to ensure program has keyboard focus when
  starting up.



Changes 4.9.7 -> 4.9.8:
* Mixer strips: Save configuration of the main mixer strips
  to disk.
* Mixer strips: Don't show error messages if deleting things
  too fast.
* Gui: Never allow a menu or a tooltip window to be the
  parent of another window.
* Mixer strip: Hide sliders immediately when deleting.
* Fix crash if the realtime error message window pops up on
  top of a window, and we delete that window before closing
  the message window.
* API: gui_getNumRowsInMixerStrips,
  gui_getMixerStripsConfiguration,
  gui_setMixerStripsConfiguration
 

Changes 4.9.6 -> 4.9.7:
* Mixer strips: Add option to set number of rows in the popup
  menu.
* Mixer strips: Reset configuration after loading song.
* Mixer: Faster to change number of rows.
* Fluidsynth: Don't show non-sf2 files in the sample browser
  when starting up.
* Sequencer: Fix "Configure block color".
* Mixer strips: Fix strip order.
* Modular mixer: Remove the zoom slider. No one probably uses
  it.
* GUI: Set width of the main window splitter handlers to 0
* Mixer strips: Also make the volume slider work when dragging
  the volume meter.
* Mixer strips: Some GFX tweaks.
* API: gui_setNumRowsInMixerStrips, gui_resetAllMixerStrips


Changes 4.9.5 -> 4.9.6:
* OSX: Fix menu fonts.
* GUI: When changing system font, don't change customly set
  fonts.
* Editor: Don't cancel range when changing LZ.
* Editor: Also expand/shrink swing when expanding/shrinking.
* Editor: Make it possible to expand/shrink by a fractional
  factor, for instance to shrink 4 lines into the space
  of 2.5 lines.
* Editor: Range can span any area. It is not limited to
  start and stop at line anymore.
* Sampler/Fluidsynth: Option to remove bookmark when informed
  about a non-existing bookmark directory.
* Help: Add info about copy/cut/paste to fxtext.html (it's a
  nice feature that is not too obvious to find just be trying
  and failing.)
* Editor: Fix copy/paste/cut first fx track. Before this commit,
  and after swing-per-track was implemented, we
  copied/pasted/cut the swing track when trying to
  cut/copy/paste the first fx track.
* GUI: Make sure requester dialogs are wide enough.
* Mixer strips: Don't create a separate mixer strip for plugins
  that has been added after a mixer strip window has opened.
  Bug introduced in 4.9.5.


Changes 4.9.3 -> 4.9.5:
* Modular mixer: Add "Show mixer strips" option for showing
  mixer strips for the currently selected instruments.
* Remove check during startup that we have write access to the
  program path.
* GUI: Make sure requester dialogs opens up in front of the
  current window, not (necessarily) the main window.
* GUI: Fix graphical updates of mixer strips and sequencer right
  after running a requester that popped up in front of a
  different window.
* Mixer strips: All popup menues contains "Hide mixer strip",
  "Configure mixer strips on/off" and "Set current instrument"
  options.
* Mixer strips: Always show a popup menu when right clicking.
* Packages: Upgrade visualization library. Fix for a switch fall
  through that could cause strange mouse behavior.
* Packages: Update qhttpserver. Fixes a ubsan hit that looked
  quite serious.
* Mixer strips: Gui to enable/disable strips
* Mixer strips: Popup-menu option to hide mixer strip.
* LZ: Fix undo. The LZ value itself was not included in the undo
  data.
* GUI: Reset "Half" and "Full" mode when the instrument is
  deleted.
* GUI: Fix instrument widget size when the "Half" button is
  selected and the instrument widget is inside the mixer.
* GUI: Don't hide sequencer when the instrument widget is inside
  the mixer and we are selecting "Half" or "Full" size.
* Player: Automatically stop hanging notes when the player jumps
  to the start of the sequencer loop. Avoids situations where more
  and more notes are added until we run out of polyphony.
* Mixer strips: Some graphical tweaks. Less borders and so forth.
* Instrument color dialog: Fix keyboard focus.
* GUI: Don't give keyboard focus to the editor when opening a new
  window. Specifically, it avoid forcing keyboard focus to the
  editor when changing current instrument. Perhaps other
  situations as well.
* GUI: Make sure the instrument configuration GUI is placed on top
  of the main window.
* Drag/drop: Don't treat dropped files if showing requesters.
* Editor: When creating new lines, let them have correct LZ value,
  not 1.
* FaustDev: Never delete editor automation when recompiling code.
* GUI: Don't force keyboard focus to editor focus when the widgets
  in the upper left corner of the editor are updated.
* FaustDev: Don't gray editor when editing source code.
* Gui: Update current instrument widget immediately after
  removing or adding a connection. Fixes bus sliders not changing
  enabled/disabled status immediately.
* API:
   * New functions: instrumentGuiIsInLowerTab, gui_moveToCentreOf.
   * gui_text: Options to align text.
   * GUI: Make gui_width and gui_height work when gui hasn't been
     shown yet.
   * gui_drawText: Fix alignment arguments. Centering options
     for vertical and horizontal were switched.

Changes 4.9.2 -> 4.9.3:
* Menus: Only navigate menus if pressing the left alt key alone.
  I.e. Don't navigate menues after pressing left alt +
  another key.
* OSX: Workaround for a Qt bug that caused mouse press and
  mouse release events to be generated artificially when we
  set new mouse cursor position. This workaround should also
  speeds up mouse operations in general. (Instead of calling
  QCursor::setPos, we call the Core Graphics function
  CGWarpMouseCursorPosition.)
* OSX: Workaround for a Qt bug that caused splitter handlers not
  to be working, and the mouse pointer not to change shape when
  hovered above a splitter handler.
* OSX: Fix some minor graphical artifacts in the editor.
* Sampler/Fluidsynth: Don't warn more than once about
  a bookmarked directory not existing anymore.
* Crashreporter: Rename executable from "crashreporter" to
  "radium_crashreporter".
* GUI: Ensure we don't input a too small max tempo multiplier
  value in the tempo automation track header.
* Menus: Fix keyboard stopping navigating menues when going
  back to previous sub menu. I.e. when pressing left arrow.
* Keyboard: Workaround to force full focus to program after
  starting program. On Linux, left alt didn't work to navigate
  windows without this workaround, and on Windows the operating
  system claimed the main window didn't have keybaord focus,
  even though Qt for some reason received keyboard events.
* OSX/OpenGL: A couple of changes that might prevent rare crash
  during startup.
* API: Only show a  normal message if calling addFx, and the
  effect already existed. Don't start assertion reporter.

Changes 4.9.1 -> 4.9.2:
* Upgrade the S7 scheme interpreter.
* Mixer strips: Minor graphical tweak.
* Audio: Fix algorithm to check if trying to create recursive
  audio graph. Bug introduced in 4.9.1.
* Mixer: Twice as fast switching to a different a/b setting.
  Earlier, the current a/b setting was applied (again) right
  before applying the new a/b setting.
* Jack: Don't freeze program when jack has shut down, and
  don't freeze if saving or exiting. These bugs might have
  been introduced around 4.8.7.
* Load: Turn off undo when cleaning mixer. Might make loading
  songs a little bit faster, especially if the song uses
  plugins that is slow to create settings data
  (VST chunks, etc).
* Internal: Don't create undo when ignoring undo. Minor general
  optimization.
* Load: Release resources obtained by bus instruments when
  loading song. MIDI learn was probably the only visible
  resource not being released, but it also leaked memory.
* Load: Fix rare crash when loading song with many instruments.
* Mixer: Don't crash when changing to a different A/B setting
  after deleting an instrument. Bug introduced in 4.9.1.
* OSX: Fix modifier key not being registered as released after
  pressing a mouse button while holding a modifier key.
  Makes Ctrl+Z work after shift+right clicking an instrument
  without having to click somewhere first, and other
  situations.
* Internal: Fixes leakage of internal object to keep track of
  playing notes. The leak happened when deleting an instrument
  while it was playing.



Changes 4.9.0 -> 4.9.1:
* Windows: Fix approximately 99.99% of the keyboard focus
  problems.
* GUI: Show full screen and close buttons on all windows by
  default.
* OSX: Fix strange error message during startup about missing
  file.
* Mouse: Fix sequencer (and more seldomly the editor) not
  always working.
* Preferences: Move the "Bring instrument widget to front"
  option from the "Windows" tab into the "Plugins" tab.
* GUI: Show message about instrument not having a GUI.
* Mixer strips: Fix replace instrument.
* Audio: Always connect and disconnect all connections
  simultaneously. Before, connections were often created and
  deleted one by one.
* Audio: Simultaneously fade out the old connections while
  fading in the new connections. Before, old connections were
  faded out before new connections were faded in.
* Mixer: Faster to create and remove audio connections.
* Player: Approx. 1.5ms faster to stop playing.
* Sequencer: Don't pause player when undoing/redoing
  automation.
* Sequencer: Fix bugs that could have caused undo/redo to
  operate on wrong tracks.
* Editor: Be more intelligent about whether to remove
  automation when replacing an instrument.
* Don't pause player unnecessarily when undoing or redoing
  removing or adding instrument.
* GUI: Try to add minimize and maximize buttons to all
  windows.
* Crashreporter: Make sure window is big enough to show all
  content


Changes 4.8.8 -> 4.9.0:
* Import mod: Remember file requester geometry, and don't
  minimize the file requester when showed for the first time.
* OpenGL: Fix pre-render blocks when loading song. Before, it
  only prerendered visible tracks. Reduces the chance of
  experiencing small delays when switching to a new block,
  especially when playing song.
* Main menus: Support the following keys when navigating the
  main menus with the keyboard: page up, page down, shift+up,
  shift+down, home, end.
* Track menu: Add "Help Swing text" entry.
* Mixer strips: Make sure the main window mixer strip doesn't
  obtain more vertical space than it needs.
* Mixer strips: Remove all margins from the main window mixer
  strip.
* Mixer strips: Remove large gap at the bottom of the mixer
  strip, especially for minimized mixer strips. Bug introduced
  in 4.8.7.
* Mixer strips: Make the background frame visible again for the
  send/insert areas. Bug introduced in 4.8.5 or 4.8.7.
* Mixer strips: Don't cancel last undo if double-clicking
  a minimized mixer strip at a position where the mouse pointer
  would end up on top of a plugin slider after the mixer strip is
  not minimized anymore.
* Quantization: Take LZ Zoomlevel into account for the quantize
  value.
* GUI: More window position tweaks.
* OSX: Increase default font sizes so that Radium looks more
  the same on the three platforms by default.
* Windows/OSX: Use the FreeType font engine instead of the font
  engine provided by the operating system.
  * Makes the three platforms look more the same.
  * Could make fonts look much better, depending on the
    operating system.
  * The default fonts look better.
  * Other fonts could look worse. If using custom fonts, you
    might need to adjust font settings.
* Audio: Less time to set an effect values. (Pre-compute port
  range hints.)
* OpenGL/OSX: Actually re-enable "draw in separate process" on
  OSX. Turns out it was only the GUI to enable
  "draw in separate process" that was re-enabled in 4.8.7.
* Playlist: Fix starting to play block when selecting a block in
  the playlist, and we were playing song.
* GUI: Fixes slow graphics that could happen when using
  automation to turn a bus on or off.
* Editor: Only show the text "Current sequencer track is pausing"
  when the current sequencer track isn't playing a block.
* OpenGL: Avoid semi-rare deadlock in situations where the
  current seqtrack isn't playing a block.
* Import Mod: Fix import mod that has tempo modifications. This
  might also fix other problems related to adding, removing or
  changing a BPM value. Bug introduced in 4.8.7.
* Import mod: Fix keyboard focus when opening the file requester.
* Audio: Some minor improvements to performance.
* Sequencer: Don't pause player when editing if playing block
  instead of playing song. The result is less audio stuttering.
* Audio: Use less time to stop playing.
* Menus: Stop navigating the menues if pressing left alt when
  the menues are active. Previously, the main menu bar was
  hidden.
* Menus: Fix showing/hiding/navigating the menues with the
  keyboard (by pressing left alt). Tested on all three platforms.
* Preferences GUI: Add a note that some GFX drivers have
  significantly lower performance if enabling
  "Draw in separate process".
* Linux: Don't lose keyboard modifiers when switching instrument
  (and possibly other situations). Fixes e.g shift+left and
  shift+right for switching to previous or next track.
* Main window: Make sure no elements in the horizontal splitter
  can collapse.
* Sequencer: Fix program freeze while trying to paint grid and
  we have zoomed in so much that there is no grid to paint.
* Log window: When shutting down, messages are shown in custom
  dialogs instead. If not these messages would never be shown,
* Sequencer: Speed up moving sequencer blocks, especially when
  playing.
* Audio: Some minor improvements to prevent xruns.
* Audio: Don't restart player if trying to switch block to the
  same block.
* Load: Show the "plugin not found" messages in the log window
  instead of custom dialog boxes so that the user doesn't have
  to click "Ok" many times.
* GUI: Fix rare program freeze that could happen when pressing
  return in the editor while a custom dialog needs reply from
  the keyboard.



Changes 4.8.7 -> 4.8.8:
* Windows/Faust Dev instrument: Don't crash. (LLVM had to be
  recompiled after upgrading the compiler.)
* Mixer strips: Make it impossible to resize the parent of the
  main window mixer strip. Also make it impossible to collaps
  the parent widget of the main window mixer strip.
* Mixer strips: Don't paint blue border around the main window
  mixer strip.
* GUI: Fix widget positions in the main window when
  adding/removing mixer widget
* GUI/Windows: Fix switching fullscreen (F11) for the mixer
  window. (This fix might have fixed other problems related to
  fullscreen as well, and not just on Windows.)
* GUI: Fix FaustDev GUI. Widget positions seems to be perfect now,
  also when selecting "half" or "full" size.
* Stability: Fix a couple of crashes that sometimes happend when
  quitting the program.
* Audio: Remove audio artifacts when disablng or enabling the
  system compressor. Happened for instruments with more than two
  output audio channels.


Changes 4.8.5 -> 4.8.7:
* Include a "Kill Jack" program with Radium. "Kill Jack" kills the
  jack server unconditionally. It could be a very useful tool.
* Re-enable "draw in separate process" on OSX. (Hopefully it
  doesn't crashes anymore.)
* Make sure message windows are opened at the centre of parent or
  screen
* OpenGL: Create shaders in the main OpenGL thread, and not in the
  OpenGL helper thread. This makes the shaders work when rendering
  in a separate process in VirtualBox. This change might make
  "draw in separate process" work on more configurations.
* OpenGL: Force linking shader immediately after creation. Also
  give an error message if linking failed. Might fix problems
  with "Draw in separate process" and other things.
* GUI: Fix keyboard focus for the input requester. Especially on
  windows, it didn't always get keyboard focus when initialized.
* GUI: Make sure the input requetser window is wide enough to
  show all content.
* GUI: Fix problem that sometimes caused the current mixer strip
  to be placed between the editor and the mixer.
* Show a "Doesn't have a gui" message when selecting
  "Show/hide GUI of current instrument" and current instrument
  doesn't have a GUI.
* GUI/Flowlayout: Horizontally centre all items.
* GUI: Fixed a couple of bugs that caused widgets not to always
  resize properly and not to always paint properly.
* Packages/libxcb: Fix compilation if python points to python3
  instead of python2. (Alyssa P. Hacker)
* Packages/libxcb: Fix compilation error caused by indentation
  errors in python file. (Alyssa P. Hacker)
* Quantitize GUI: Don't synchronize the quantitize value across
  quantitize GUIs. Each quantitize GUI has it's own value.
* Quantitize GUI: The inserted value will no longer be
  automatically divided by greatest common denominator.
* Ratio GUI: Pressing control causes denominator to change value
  when using mouse wheel. (Instead of changing the numerator
  value)
* Ratio GUI: Possible to write floating point numbers.
* Ratio GUI: Writing e.g. "9/b" will be converted to "9/1", not
  "0/1".
* Ratio GUI: Writing e.g. "b/9" will be converted to "0/9", not
  "0/1".
* Import mod: Fix keyboard focus in file requester
* Progress window: Fix flickering, and fix not always working
  properly.
* Swing: Make the editor use current track swing setting when
  swinging along while playing
* Mixer Strips: mixer strips: Add "Show Info" popup menu option
  when right clicking an instrument
* Import MIDI: Don't show assertion reporter when importing MIDI
  while playing
* Fix keyboard focus in vst path line edit widget
* Preferences: Various GUI tweaks.
* Don't pause player when copying a track. This bug also
  manifested istelf on lots of other functions.
* Sequencer height is always remembered and constant.
* Instrument height is always minimal.
* Jack Transport: Fully implemented, includin an option to let
  Radium be the "Jack Timebase Master". Enable under the
  "Sequencer" tab in preferences.
* Input requester: Pop up a modal window. Never show it between the
  menus and the editor anymore. (Created keyboard problems and
  often autoresized the main window.)
* Mixer strips: Minor fix to instrument border rendering.
* Don't show assertion reporter when moving very short notes in the
  piano bar.
* Lots of assertions that we are not calling update()/show()/exec()
  while painting.
* Always use radium_error_message program to show message when
  painting or loading song. Fix for crash.
* Fix the radium_error_message program program. It didn't
  properly wait for start and finish.
* Put the sequencer and the instrument into a new tab bar. Also
  added a new tab called "Edit".
* Move stylesheet css into a separate file called
  "bin/stylesheet.css" so that it can be modified without
  recompiling, and also modified by user.
* Some Qt stylesheet tweaks
* Let QScrollArea widgets have transparent background
* API:
  * GUI: Make sure tab background is correct
  * GUI: Fix empty color for gui_text
  * GUI: Various bug fixes
  * GUI: Add "rotate" parameter to gui_drawText
  * GUI: By default, there are no spacing or borders
  * GUI: Don"t call resize callback again if it failed.
  * GUI: Fix keyboard focus for line requesters that has no
    callback
  * GUI: First argument to gui_ratio can also be a string or a
    float.
  * setQuantitize: First argument can also be a string or a float.
  * getQuantitize: Take an optional argument "as_string". If true,
    returns quantitize value as string instead of ratio.
  * GUI: Workaround for a Qt bug causing callback for gui_line to
    be called twice. (QTBUG-40. Reported in 2005!)
  * New functions: gui_verticalSplitter, gui_horizontalSplitter,
    gui_setAsWindow, gui_removeTab, gui_currentTab,
    gui_setCurrentTab, gui_getTabPos,
    gui_minimizeAsMuchAsPossible, gui_getMainXSplitter,
    gui_getSequencerGui, gui_getInstrumentGui, gui_getTabBar,
    gui_numTabs, gui_tabName, gui_getSplitterHandle,
    getRatioFromString, getStringFromRatio



Changes 4.8.3 -> 4.8.5:
* Fix a bug in the jack check program that made it not always
  work.
* Let radium_check_jack_status also check opening input ports.
* Make the crashreporter window always pop up in front of other
  windows.
* Update s7 scheme interpreter.
* Fix crash if playing right after loading MIDI file. I could
  only make it crash on Windows, but the underlying bug causing
  this crash could have caused crashes in other situations and
  on other platforms as well.
* Removing the hermes filter ladspa plugin since it was very
  unstable.
* Removed the surround encoder ladspa plugins since the
  documentation for it says that it hasn't been tested.
* Show the "Bookmarked sample directory doesn't exist anymore"
  message in the log message window instead of opening a
  new dialog.
* Plugin manager: Add "Show Info" popup menu to show instrument
  info.
* Add info about whether a plugin is an instrument to the plugin
  info window.
* Save old file as <filename>.bak when saving file.
* Inform that Radium should be restarted after scanning plugins
  (in case an unstable, but non-crashing, plugin was loaded while
  scanning).
* Don't freeze when the program receives SIGINT while playing.
* Improve performance changing sample for the sampler instrument
  or the fluidsynth instrument.
* Fix showing text in the message window that contains <, >, or
  other characters that could confuse the html renderer.
* Pop up the message window and show scheme history when catching
  an error.
* If soundfile can't be found, check the "sounds" directory of
  the program before asking the user.
* Set lighter background color for the post-recording dialog.
* Paint gui groups with a more distinct background color.
* Various internal changes to prevent bugs.
* Various internal changes to detect bugs.
* Some internal changes to improve performance.
* API:
  * Make functions returning Place/dyn_t*/func_t* available to
    Python. Radium does not return any value from these
    functions when called from Python though.
  * Don't allow -1 as a place anymore. Use 'same-place instead.
    This in order to detect if setting a place to -1 by mistake.
  * Removed: callFunc_void_int_bool
  * Added: evalSchemeWithReturn, getHtmlFromText, gui_ratio,
    gui_setStyleSheet, gui_setStyleSheetRecursively,
    setQuantitize, getQuantitizeType, setQuantitizeType,
    gui_flowlayout
 

Changes 4.8.2 -> 4.8.3:
* Current mixer strip: Fix resize of wide strip, and don't show
  two strips above each other in certain situations.
* Mixer strips: Make sure the label of a minimized mixer strip is
  always at least two characters high.
* Async file requester when loading protracker module.
* API:
  * GUI: Support tabs container (gui_tabs/gui_addTab)
  * Deleted: importMod
  * New: requestImportMod, gui_fileRequester, gui_tabs, gui_addTab,
    gui_className



Changes 4.8.1 -> 4.8.2:
* Windows: Make sure that notification windows, shown during,
  startup, are not hidden by other windows.


Changes 4.8.0 -> 4.8.1:
* Update s7 scheme interpreter.
* Fix semi-rare freeze when undoing block position in the
  sequencer while playing.
* Fix window-on-top and remember-geometry for the help windows.
* Fix LLVM 4.0 incompat with faust. (Teteros)
* API: gui_web


Changes 4.7.9 -> 4.8.0:
* Various fixes to reduce flickering when opening windows
* Open the main window at the centre of screen during startup.
  (On Linux, it often opened up in the upper left corner.)
* Make sure all new windows are opened at the centre position of the
  parent window.
* Fix remember geometry for the Preferences window
* OSX: Fix window on-top-of hierarchy. Turned out
  QWidget::setParent() doesn't make windows always stay on top of
  each other on OSX (which they do on all other platforms). The
  workaround is a combination of tool windows and modal windows.
  The workaround behaves approximately the same way and is applied
  to all platforms.
* Replace all use of usleep. May fix some bugs on windows, where
  usleep doesn't work if asking to sleep more than one second.
* Show taller async message window initially.
* Sequencer: Don't repaint when a non-async window is visible.
  This avoids blank sequencer graphics in some situations.
* Set default button in message windows. I.e. when pressing the
  Return or Enter key, the default button is pushed. The default
  button is the rightmost one on Window and Linux (mostly),
  and it's the leftmost one on OSX. (It's the same button, but
  systems displays button order differently.)
* Detect during startup if the jack server is malfunctioning, and
  kill it if it does. Don't just freeze Radium, as before. This
  also releaves the user from killing the jack server manually,
  which is a little bit complicated.
* Mixer: Fix modular mixer height cut in half when pressing the "M"
  button two times.
* Mixer strips: Fix gui leak for narrow-sized mixer strips. Two
  unused widgets were created every time a narrow-sized mixer
  strip was created or recreated, and they were never deleted.
  This could probably have taken up significant amounts of memory
  after a while.
* OSX/Plugin manager: Workaround for non-working Return and Enter
  keys.
* Show the "About" window asynchronously.
* Don't crash if a plugin asks for timing information outside
  realtime audio thread. Also shows warning window if a plugin
  does this. This avoids crash after closing the "Moody Sampler"
  AU plugin.
* Plugin manager: Many fixes.
* Plugins: Many fixes to the way we load plugins.
* API:
  * Reduce scheduling resolution from 90ms to 5ms. (Increases
    performance on some gui-related things.)
  * GUI: Optimize adding/removing rows to/from table. (Increases
    plugin manager performance)
  * GUI: Don't cancel various virtual methods (paint/resize/etc.)
    from running when a non-async window is visible. This avoids
    some of blank widgets when showing file requesters, etc.
  * GUI: Don't crash when deleting a table cell gui.
  * GUI: Clean up, make faster, and make safer, the way we
    store, lookup, and organize qwidgets. (It was possible to
    crash it before.)
  * addMessage: Call showMessage if the underlying scheme file
    that addMessage uses has not been loaded yet.
  * Removed the char* type. Can only use const_char* now.
  * New functions: gui_numOpenGuis. gui_hasKeyboardFocus


Changes 4.7.8 -> 4.7.9:
* Fix some minor plugin scanning issues, such as making it
  possible to rescan previously blacklisted plugins.
* Add OS version to crash report.
* Plugin manager: Make Home/End keys work.
* Plugin manager: Let the Return and Enter keys select plugin,
  and let the Escape key cancel/close window. 
* Show non-critical and non-interactive messages in a static log
  message window. I.e. no need to press "OK" to continue. Not all
  messages have been changed to do this yet though.
* Add "Show plugin manager" entry to the windows menu.
* More fixes to make mixer widget and other windows remember
  geometry.
* Various fixes to make sure windows are put on top of the
  correct window.
* API: gui_addKeyCallback, openPluginManager, addMessage,
  gui_setText, gui_setStaticToplevelWidget, getDateString,
  getTimeString.


Changes 4.7.7 -> 4.7.8:
* Fix undo in the sequencer when inserting lines in a block
* Workaround for a couple of Qt bugs causing crashes
  when opening menues and doing mouse operations in
  the modular mixer.
* Fix async menues.
* Plugin manager: "Rescan all" button.
* If there are several plugin files with the same name, load all
  of them, and figure out which one to use. Give warning if more
  than one was usable.


Changes 4.7.6 -> 4.7.7:
* Store on disk the result of scanning a plugin, plus store a
  blacklist of plugins that crashed during scanning.
* Fix problems changing A/B state that was loaded with the song.
* Mouse: Fix mouse pointer position after editing in the editor
* Fix keyboard focus in async popup menues
* API: getMaxSubmenuEntries / setMaxSubmenuEntries


Changes 4.7.4 -> 4.7.6:
* Show popup menu with the presests from the last used directory,
  also when selecting "<Load New Preset>" from the track header,
  and "Load" from the instrument widget header.
* Don't show assertion reporter when loading multi preset
  from track header menu.
* Make sure only ONE undo entry is added when creating a new
  instrument from the track header menu.
* Mixer: Always place it on top of main window.
* Try to fix plugin deletion crash on OSX when CPU is buzy for
  at least 5 seconds after closing.
* Turned off "draw in separate process" on OSX for now since
  it's been reported to be unstable.
* Various stuff to make sure windows are placed on top of the
  correct parent window
* Made both replace and load instrument interfaces async. 
* Fix recent load song crashes plus many other potentially
  crashy situations.
* Plugin manager: Enabled.
* "Show instrument window when double-clicking" is now off
  by default.
* Plugin manager.
* Made instrument popup menu async.
* Fix vsync warning message during startup
* Log more undo info
* API:
  * Added: obtainKeyboardFocus, releaseKeyboardFocus,
    gui_setModal, getGlobalMousePointerX,
    getGlobalMousePointerY, gui_moveToParentCentre,
    showAsyncMessage, createInstrumentDescriptionPopupMenu,
    getAllPresetsInPath,
    requestLoadPresetInstrumentDescription,
    instrumentPresetInClipboard, autoconnectInstrument,
    gui_addDeletedCallback, gui_addRealtimeCallback
  * Removed: instrumentDescriptionPopupMenu,
    requestLoadPresetInstrumentDescription.
  * Renamed: gui_setAlwaysOnTop -> gui_setParent,
    replaceInstrument -> requestReplaceInstrument,
    loadInstrumentPreset -> requestLoadInstrumentPreset,
  * Made doubleClickCallback work with tables
  * showMessage: Add button options
  * GUI: Large table speed up.
  * GUI: All toplevel windows remember geometry
  * GUI: Implement :get-value for table


Changes 4.7.3 -> 4.7.4:
* Mixer strips: 4X faster to create/recreate.
* Mixer strips: Fix freeze if several bus paths have common
  targets.
* Fix mouse pointer position when editor is not visible. This
  fixes mouse pointer moving to lower right corner when
  editing sequencer automation.
* Don't crash if failing to load a plugin when loading song.
* Options to load and save single blocks and tracks.
  Instruments and automations are not loaded yet though.
* Save instrument comments into .rec and .mrec files
* shure -> sure (Teteros)

* API: appendPaths, removeSchedule, getSoundPluginRegistry,
  populatePluginContainer, gui_addTableRows,
  gui_getNumTableRows, gui_getTableRowNum, gui_sortTableBy,
  gui_stretchTable, gui_setEnabled, gui_table,
  gui_addTableCell, gui_enableTableSorting.


Changes 4.7.2 -> 4.7.3:
* Make sure all timing data is updated after loading song.
  Fix for weird behaviors after loading song.
* Swing help text fixes.



Changes 4.7.1 -> 4.7.2:
* Don't crash when changing global tempo and there is more than
  one block.

  unstable.



Changes 4.6.9 -> 4.7.0:
* Various fixes to prevent the s7 garbage collector from collecting
  non-garbage.
* Refuse to compile if using clang<3.4, or gcc<5. Swing won't
  always work if using a compiler without sufficent support for
  integer overflow checks.
* Show "hide swing track" popup menu to the editor.
* Soundfilesaver: Add tooltip to the resampler type combo box.



Changes 4.6.8 -> 4.6.9:
* Let new bpmtext/lpbtext/swingtext entries be non-gliding by
  default.
* Temporary hack to prevent a CPU spike when starting to play in the
  middle of a block. If sample seek is enabled for an instrument,
  there will still be a small CPU spike, but only for that
  instrument. A proper fix should be included in the next release.
  (bug introduced in 4.6.7)
* Mixer: Fix error about creating recursive connection when
  changing a/b.
* Don't show assertion reporter, and don't calculate wrong time,
  if moving a tempo automation node to the top of a block.
* Mixer: Remember window geometry.
* Swing track. (Just the block track for now, swing sub-tracks will
  be added later)
* Fix delete signature.
* Fix copying signature track.



Changes 4.6.7 -> 4.6.8:
* Some debug code to track down a bug in the sampler player.
* Upgrade s7. The previous version had a memory corruption.
* Poor man's sample seek. Should work work fine for playing long
  samples without any type of loops or pitch changes.
  Check the "S" box in the plugin header to enable.



Changes 4.6.6 -> 4.6.7:
* Mixer: Update volume slider in modular mixer when changing a/b.

* A new song properties window in the project menu. Currently only has
  options to change accelerando and ritardando types.
* New methods to calculate accelerando / ritardando
* Add glide/hold options to the BPM track. I.e. not necessary to use
  the tempo automation track to gradually change tempo.
* API: setRandomInstrumentSample,
  setRandomSampleForAllSelectedInstruments, getInstrumentTypeName,
  getInstrumentPluginName, getSelectedInstruments
    


Changes 4.6.3 -> 4.6.4:
* Fix popup menu for instrument objects in the modular mixer
* Song comment window: Change title from "Dialog" to "Song Comment"
  and don't open the window modally.


Changes 4.6.2 -> 4.6.3:
* Fix removing BPM and LPB entries from the BPM track and LPB track.


Changes 4.6.0 -> 4.6.2:
* Build: Compile with -O2 instead of -O3 for non-CPU intensive files
  to improve backtrace.
* Mixer: Fix bug that could cause the Instrument widget to be
  positioned above the Modular Mixer widget.
* Mouse: Make it possible to move the the editor scrollbar with the
  mouse.
* Mixer: More work to avoid, and to track down why, the assertion
  reporter sometimes pops up (and undo/redo stops working) when
  releasing the mouse button. (It's a quite rare problem though.)
* Fix tooltips for the BPM and LPB text input widgets.
* Don't show assertion reporter when loading a new instrument preset
  and there are no preset files in the current directory.
* API: Let getBlockLength, getSongLength, and lineDuration return

  getEditorScrollbarScrollerY1, getEditorScrollbarScrollerY2



Changes 4.5.9 -> 4.6.0:
* Windows: Don't show lots of console windows when opening the crash
  reporter.
* Menus: remove "(under development)" from the mixer strips window
  entries.
* Doc: Merge mixer and mixerstrips documentation into one page.
* Menus: Add "Show Quantization and Track Monoization Window" entry
  to the windows menu.
* Possible to press any key (not just return) to add signature when
  the cursor is placed in the signature track.
* Fix pressing the DEL key to delete chance text.
* No need to press return to add/edit numbers in the LPB and BPM
  tracks anymore. Instead, just write the numbers directly.
* More attempts to avoid progress window flickering.
* Minor performance improvement to Zita Reverb.
* Mixer strip: Switch between wide/narrow mode when clicking the
  name of the current instrument.


Changes 4.5.8 -> 4.5.9:

  Clicking the name of the mixer strip of the current instrument
  changes wide/narrow mode, as before.
* Mixer: Add an "I" checkbox to switch between putting the
  instrument widget in the bottom of the mixer, or putting the
  instrument widget in the bottom of the main window.
* Mixer: Add a "W" button to show the mixer in a separate window

* API: Changed "getSampleRate" to return integer instead of float



Changes 4.5.2 -> 4.5.4:
* Mixer: Checkbox to show/hide connections.
* Mixer: Apply volume/muting/soloing/bypassing changes to all
  selected objects.
* Mixer: Update mixer object volume sliders when undoing.
* Show arrow letter, not "=>", above the rightmost arrow in the
  instrument window.
* Mixer: Popup menu options to unsolo/mute/unmute all objects,
  and options to solo/mute/unsolo/unmute all selected objects.
* Mixerstrips: Update send sliders when a value is changed from
  another mixer strip.
* OSX: Give up, and disable high CPU protection on this platform.
  It really seems like Apple goes to great lengths to make programs
  use 100% CPU in OpenGL applications when the window is not visible
  (i.e. they are not just transforming 'OpenGL Swap' into a dummy
  function, which would be stupid enough by itself, albeit managable).
  To illustrate how hard this problem is, the code in the JUCE library
  to work around the same problem doesn't work properly either, so in
  all JUCE OpenGL applications and plugins running on OSX, you are
  likely to see a little bit of graphics stuttering now and then
  caused by JUCE's high CPU protection logic. On most OpenGL
  applications, this is not a big deal, but in Radium, where there
  are very big movements and close interactions between user and
  OpenGL graphics, it's very noticable and annoying. A workaround
  may exist in OSX 10.9 and later, but I'm not sure I want to
  prevent Radium from running on OSX 10.8 yet.



Changes 4.5.0 -> 4.5.2:
* OSX: Fix the 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 keys when using a french keyboard
* Osx/sierra: Workaround for crash in qt when exiting program
* Upgrade Visualization-Library. Fix for rare startup crash,
  especially on OSX.
* Enable draw in separate process by default, and also force-enable
  it if it earlier had been excplicitly disabled.
* Windows: Fix draw in separate process.
* Crashreporter: On windows, report crashes as crashes, not errors.
* Don't crash crashreporter when showing assertion from a different
  thread than the main thread.
* OSX: Fix system font on 10.12.
* Use system font in the playlist.
* Some debug code to try to track down an undo bug in the mixer
* Windows: Fix use of non-ascii paths for sndfile, libgig,
  and the crashreporter.
* Make the "Quit" button in the system message window actually quit
  the program
* Windows: Fix starting program if the current path contains
  non-asci characters.
* Mixer strips: General speed up, plus fix ctrl to slow down mouse



Changes 4.4.8 -> 4.5.0:
* OSX: Enable draw in separate process by default. Quick temporary
  workaround for OpenGL freeze problem.
* Fix using left meta to force horizontal movement when pressing keyboard
  before mouse.
* OSX: Use left alt instead of left meta to force horizontal movement.
  Left meta is already used to slow down mouse movement on OSX.
* Updated keyboard modifiers in the Help -> Mouse menu so that they are
  correct for all three platforms.
* Don't crash when selecting "Quit" after getting message that OpenGL is
  too old during startup.
* Mixer strips: Various gfx improvements.
* Mixer strips: Speed up rendering a lot.
* Mixer strips: Menu options to show window with 1, 2, or 3 rows
  of mixer strips.
* Mixer strips: Click name to switch between a narrow and a wide strip.
* Mixerstrips: Fix full screen.
* A general fix for popup menues not always working, especially
  in mixer strips.
* Make the "ignore warnings and errors for two seconds" and
  "ignore warnings and errors for the rest of the program" buttons
  work again.
* Preferences: Fix some usage of wrong font types.
* Progress window: Should quit by itself now if Radium crashes
  (or is killed) while progress window is open.
* Progress window: Remove flickering when printing new message.
  Works perfectly on Linux/Windows, but not on OSX, as usual.
* Avoid rare deadlock when playing looped range.
* Sequencer: Fix painting correct bar numbers when block tempo != 0.
* Sequencer: Fix program freeze when painting bar numbers.
* API: Renamed ctrlPressed to controlPressed. 'controlPressed' returns
  true if Ctrl is pressed on Linux/Windows, and if Cmd is pressed on OSX.
* API: New functions: control2Pressed, gui_addPaintCallback, gui_update,
  hasWideInstrumentStrip, setWideInstrumentStrip,
  gui_toolTip, gui_drawVerticalText.


Changes 4.4.7 -> 4.4.8:
* Audio: Make it optional whether to use buzy looping as synchronization
  primitive in the multicore scheduler. Buzy looping may cause CPU spikes
  if a plugin uses more than one thread to process audio.
* More intelligent way to check if OpenGL uses too much CPU. On OSX the
  old way didn't work quite well since it seemed like the OS used a lot
  of time right after re-rendering the editor, which it also did, but
  not for so long that we needed to pause the rendering.
* Removed the "Experimental feature" text from the auto-suspend and
  recalculate options in the preferences window. Those seems to work fine.
* Mixer strips: Automatically scale font size, if necessary, so that we
  always see all text.
* Added mixer strips help to the Help menu.
* Add "Add automation to current sequencer track" option to effect slider
  popup menu



Changes 4.4.6 -> 4.4.7:
* OSX: Let the Cmd key behave as Ctrl key again. This is an emergency fix
  since Ctrl+mouse click turned out to be interpreted as a right click
  on OSX. More work needed though.
* Revert to multicore scheduler from Radium V4.4.4. The new one had
  CPU spikes.
* Sequencer: Fix changing loop start position when mixer strip for current
  instrument is visible and on the left side
* Cache sample directories.
* Sequencer: Option to show bar numbers instead of time in the timeline.
* Show loading sample directory progress status in the progress window
  instead of the editor, if the progress window is visible.
* Disable painting when loading song. Less flickering, and hopefully
  also fixes a rare crash during startup.
* Draw a tiny track header border when several tracks are merged together
  into one track header
* Sequencer: Fix moving the navigation bar when the current mixer strip
  is visible and on the left side



Changes 4.4.5 -> 4.4.6:
* Don't scroll editor when using the mouse wheel on various text fields,
  such as changing various ratios or a piano roll interval.
* Fix tooltip for the piano roll header.
* Fix a quite rare bug in mixer strip that prevented it from showing
* Fix undo/redo when splitting a track into monophonic tracks
* Add option to automatically split recorded tracks into monophonic
  tracks after recording.
* Never swap OpenGL while creating or deleting a plugin or a plugin
  window. Could fix some rare crashes if using a semi-buggy GFX driver
  with plugins using OpenGL.
* Option to turn off the high CPU usage check in the OpenGL thread.
* Make sure the solo button in the mixer strips is updated when pressing
  the solo button in the instrument widget
* Don't create undo when changing solo
* Improved spinlock implementation
* Many thread sanitizer fixes. Might fix subtle bugs.
* Compile using boost 1.63 by default
* API: numSelectedInstruments/instrumentIsSelected



Changes 4.4.4 -> 4.4.5:
* Fix crash when loading song that has a sequencer track with no
  sequencer blocks.
* Improve multi core scheduler somewhat. The improvement might not be
  measurable, but it shouldn't be worse than before. Still room for
  improvement.
* Several thread sanitizer fixes. Could fix some subtle bugs.
* Make it impossible to enable safe mode (it is not safe to enable
  safe mode).
* Add c/c++ version and s7 version to about window.
* Audio meters: Fix falloff speed. Don't falloff faster when there are
  more instruments.


Changes 4.4.3 -> 4.4.4:
* Mixer strips: Don't set volume to 6Db if it's above +6 Db when showing
  mixer strip.
* Fix bug causing assertion window to pop up when adding note with
  value 0 in the note text area.


Changes 4.4.2 -> 4.4.3:
* Windows: Include test version of jack 1.9.11. (I've been using
  it for almost a year, and it includes a newer version of qjackctl.)
* OSX: Workaround for the OS failing to set normal threading priority
  on 10.12
* Mixer strips: Make sure the windows are always on top of the
  main window
* Fix a crash during shutdown
* Draw green rectangle around mute buttons when the instrument is
  implicitly muted (i.e. muted because some other instrument is soloed)
* Change audio multi core scheduler to buzy loop when waiting for new
  tasks. This increases audio performance, but also increases the
  overall CPU usage.
* Audio recording: By default, save new audio files in a subdirectory
  of the song file.
* Audio recording: Plug tiny memory leak.
* Audio recording: Don't check in the realtime thread if the file
  path exists.
* Mixer strip: By default, show the current mixer strip on the left
  side of the main window.
* Sequencer: Fix sequencer automation when block tempo is not 1.0.
* Preferences: Move some window related options from the "Various" tab
  to the "Windows" tab.

* Fix overriding keybinding, where the original keybinding only has
  integer arguments, while the new keybinding have at least one
  argument which is not integer
* API: Rename instrumentActive to instrumentIsOpen,
* API: Rename gui_is_open to gui_isOpen
* API: New functions: schedule, hideInstrumentGui, instrumentGuiIsVisible


Changes 4.4.1 -> 4.4.2:
* Don't un-mute an instrument when changing volume
* Mixer: Don't create volume slider undo before actually moving the slider

* Upgrade the S7 scheme interpreter


Changes 4.4.0 -> 4.4.1:
* Mixerstrip: Implement ctrl-clicking mute and solo buttons
* Mixerstrips: Fix F11 for mixer strips window, and only show full screen
  of the currently pointed at mixer strips window
* Windows/OSX: Fix keyboard input for mixer strips windows
* Sequencer: Don't crash when deleting instrument that has automation
* Sequencer: Replace sequencer automation intelligently when an instrument
  is replaced.
  I.e. transfer system volume automation to new instrument, and so forth.
* Made most popup menues async so that they don't block audio meters and so
  forth. Instrument selector is still synchronized though.
* Added a little space to the left of the checkboxes in the popup menues.
* Mixerstrips: Only show legal alternatives when replacing a send or a sink
* Mixerstrips: Don't delete the old sink instrument when replacing, just
  disconnect it.
* Plugin selector: Only enable plugins that fits. For example, if
  replacing an instrument that has both input and output connections, we
  can only replace it with a plugin that has input and output connections

  is visible.
* Mixer: Keep old position when replacing an instrument (bug introduced
  in 4.4.0)

* Don't send pitch change messages when the value is the same as
  last time. Minor optimization + that it screwed up automatic
  portamento a little bit.
* Always show warning during startup if VSync is turned off. It's
  most likely a mistake if it's turned off.

  (I.e automatically glide between notes and pitches)
* Change default behavior to not stop playing when saving song.
* Make sure various information about Linux GFX drivers are not
  showed unless actually running Linux.
* Add new option called "Glide to next note at mouse position"
  to the pianonote popup menu.

* Linux: Fix use of embedded libxcb.
* Fix song tempo widget size after loading a song with a visible
  song tempo widget.

* Add "Hide song tempo automation" option to song tempo automation
  popup menu.
* Ensure graphics is updated when changing song tempo automation.



Changes 4.2.8 -> 4.2.9:
* More fixes for open hand mouse pointer.
* Removed some startup warnings about unstable gfx drivers
  and so forth on Linux. With latest version of libxcb,
  this will hopefully not be a problem anymore.
* Linux: Include xcb-proto 1.12 and libxcb 1.12. All versions
  of xcb before 1.11.1 (which is quite new) are probably
  unstable if using AMD or Intel gfx drivers.
* Fix high CPU usage when sequencer window is visible



Changes 4.2.7 -> 4.2.8:
* Write a warning in capitol letters next to the vsync option in the
  preferences. (Disabling vsync only makes sense using buggy gfx
  drivers.)
* Sequencer looping.
* Make sure the mouse pointer looks like a pointer when it is
  supposed to be a pointer.
* Fix text cluttering in the sequencer timeline when using another
  system font than the default.

  2. Editing notes in piano roll, 3. Scrolling editor up and down with
  the arrow keys, and 4. When playing using the computer keyboard.
  Also add option to the preferences to keep original MIDI channel
  when using MIDI keyboard.
* Use the system font height to determine sequencer dimensions, not the
  editor font height.
* Send actual time to plugins. I.e. remove block tempo multiplication
  and song tempo automation out of the picture.

* Song tempo automation



Changes 4.2.6 -> 4.2.7:
* Make fewer undo points when moving sequencer blocks
* Attempt to lower file requester startup time on windows
* Show sequencer grid graphically when moving blocks
* Only use first sequencer track to define grid
* Scrolling the mouse wheel down stops the player and
  sets cursor position in the sequencer.

  I.e. already playing notes doesn't suddenly change
  between playing backards and forwards.
* Fix "Block Copy" and "Block Paste" in the menus
* Fix semi-rare crash that could happen right after
  a sequencer is deleted or changed, for instance after
  loading a song.
* Fix sequencer grid when a block tempo multiplier doesn't
  have the value 1.0.
* Update note graphics in the sequencer immediately.
* Configure instrument colors (select "Configure color"
  from the track header or mixer sound object popup menus).
* Warn about all Mesa 10 Linux Intel GFX drivers during startup.
  It seems like Radium could crash at any time if using
  these drivers.
* Possibly improve audio performance by reducing cache misses.
  Memory usage has decreased a little bit too.



Changes 4.2.5 -> 4.2.6:
* Mouse: Don't bar-align the first block in the sequencer.
* Mouse: Always move the sequencer blocks the same number of pixels.
* Option to recalculate latency on the fly when turning on/off
  a bus connection. Saves a lot of CPU on songs with many instruments.
  This is probably just a temporary workaround for the CPU problem
  until a proper solution is implemented. Latency should not be
  recalculated when you turn on/off of a bus connection since
  it produces minor artifacts (caused by interpolation) and also
  causes minor temporary tempo changes (i.e. at least one beat will
  have a different length than the surrounding beats).
* Fix mouse problems when moving sequencer blocks. A very common
  problem on OSX, but it has also been observed on Linux.
* Fix rare assertion window popup when loading song.



Changes 4.2.4 -> 4.2.5:
* Don't paste color when pasting block
* Move sequencer blocks in the vertical direction as well as the
  horizontal direction.
* Always hide sequencer window if instrument window is half or
  full size.
* Let new blocks have 64 lines by default, not 70.
* Mouse: Align sequencer blocks by bar positions in the sequencer
  track(s) above. Pressing ctrl (to finetune) prevents automatic
  alignment.
* Update default sequencer colors.
* Legalize sequencer block positions when timing has been changed.
* Paint bars and beats in the sequencer.
* Fix rare hang when loading song or protracker module.
* Don't show assertion reporter if the user doesn't have physical
  jack output ports.
* Always select the block when right clicking on a block in the
  sequencer.
* Options to replace block under mouse with current/existing/new
  block, in sequencer popup menu.
* Add "configure block" option to sequencer block popup menu.
* Option to configure block colors. Block colors are also saved
  to disk.
* Hide progress window when showing message so that it doesn't
  cover the message window.
* Regularly make sure progress window is on top when open.
* Various preferences gui adjustments.
* Windows: Fix keyboard after Radium was brought to foreground
  again after being minimized by clicking the taskbar icon.
* Include Linux Intel 10.3.3 driver in list of GFX drivers to
  show warning about.



Changes 4.2.3 -> 4.2.4:

  triggered by MIDI or computer input.
* Don't multiply tempo with the block tempo multiplier of
  block #0 when pausing.
* Unique block colors in the sequencer.
* Various sequencer navigator GFX tweaks.
* Option to lock juce when swapping opengl. Might prevent some
  plugins from crashing when opening native GUI.
* Minor pitch line GFX tweak.
* Tweak sequencer "piano roll" painting.
* Ensure scheduler is really cleared before starting to play.
  Should prevent the assertion reporter from popping up in
  some situations.
* Ask VST3 and AU plugins for audio tail length instead of
  using default value.



Changes 4.2.2 -> 4.2.3:
* Switch editor block when clicking a block in the sequencer
* Draw blue border around current block in the sequencer
* Pd: fix a bug that happened when loading long lines. The bug could
  for instance cause mininum and maximum slider values to be lost.
* Fix the functions for selecting next and previous playlist position.
  (ra.selectNextPlaylistBlock and ra.selectPrevPlaylistBlock)
* Fix play song from current position
* Fix a scheduling bug that sometimes caused events to be scheduled
  at the wrong time.

  of GUI element asked for keyboard input simultaneously and/or
  more than one input requester window was visible.
* Upgrade to Juce 4.2.4
* Some emergency scheduler fixes. Some things still not working.

  a divide by zero assertion in debug mode.
* Fix possible freeze in automation scheduler
* Fix a couple of memory corruptions when using the MIDI instrument.
* Started work on a vertical timeline sequencer. More than one sequencer
  track is supported, but only one is visible for now.
* Add 64 bit integer type to the API
* Fix semi-rare scheduler crash(es) when doing pitch and velocity
  operations.
* Fix a division by zero occurence in the Editor renderer.



Changes 4.2.0 -> 4.2.1:
* Update block play positions in the playlist after changing
  a block length. (Bug introduced in 4.1.7)


Changes 4.1.9 -> 4.2.0:
* Use less time deleting plugins that have thousands of parameters
* Remove a couple of situations where the assertion reporter
  popped up unnecessarily.
* Fix loading songs that contain AU and VST3 plugins.
* Disable changing presets for VST3 plugins, at least for now
  since it's not working.



Changes 4.1.8 -> 4.1.9:
* Play block when selecting a block in the block selector.
  It didn't work before when playing song.
* Warn about old Intel Linux GFX driver during startup.
* Reorganize the instrument header buttons.
* Don't load a VST3 plugin when you meant to load the VST plugin
  with the same name, plus 5 other similar situations.
  I.e. set the type name of a VST3 plugins to "VST3" (not "VST")
  and the type name of audio unit plugins to "AudioUnit" (not "VST"). 
* Various minor VST/VST3/AU fixes. 



Changes 4.1.7 -> 4.1.8:

  when deleting an instrument. Just stop it once if necessary.
  (Fixes xrun-like sound when deleting instrument)
* Sampler: make "note adjust" floating number.
* Show the "Reset" option when trying to reset the current
  a/b setting setting. Display it in disabled mode though.
  (It was a bit confusing when nothing happened before.)



Changes 4.1.5 -> 4.1.6:
* Don't fill up undo log when adding undo for all effects of an instrument.

  channel value to the notes.
* Fix sliders in the FaustDev instrument when pressing "half" or "full".

* Put the "Show controls" check box and sample browser
  back to the old positions in the instrument widget.



Changes 4.1.2 -> 4.1.3:
* Hide splashscreen if showing a message during startup.
* Always autosuspend buses, pipes, patchbay instruments, and the
  sampler instrument.
* Buttons for doing A/B testing (A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H testing).
* Don't autosuspend current instrument when not playing.
  (Annoying to look at flickering mixer objects.)
* Add a close button to the MIDI learn configuration window.
* Rearrange plugin parameters when changing size between
  normal/half/full. (Show less tabs in half or full mode).
* Fix display of CPU usage for the current instrument when
  showing CPU usage in the mixer.
* Don't write "Auto-suspended" immediately in the top of the
  instrument widget when instrument is auto-suspended.

  when a note was added from MIDI input.
* Add inputs/outputs/latency/tail/time of last last activity to the
  instrument info box.
* Grey out auto-suspending sound objects in the mixer, in realtime.
* Various auto-suspend tweaks and bug fixes
* By default, disable auto-suspend for zita reverb in new songs.
* Instruments can optionally override default auto-suspend behavior.
* Autoposition instruments in the mixer (again) when importing MOD.
* Fix general buggy behavior when closing text line requesters.
* Allow cancelling adding a new MIDI port.
* Many bug fixes and tweaks for auto-suspend.
* Show requester windows at mouse position.
* Let Escape key exit editing number boxes



Changes 4.1.0 -> 4.1.1:
* Option to auto-bypass instruments. The feature turns off processsing for
  an instrument when it has been inactive for a specified amount of time,
  i.e. when it has not received or produced any audio or events.
  This can save lots of CPU. Note that this bypass is not the same as
  the mixer-bypass. The mixer-bypass only turns down the volume,
  but it doesn't turn off processing.
* Fix bug causing assertion reporter to pop up when changing tempo etc.
  (bug introduced in 4.1.0)
* Run plugins also when dry/wet value is 0% or bypassing. If not,
  delaying plugins might cause old audio to suddenly kick in when
  unbypassing. Other artifacts may have occured too because of this.
* Upgraded s7 scheme interpreter to latest version.
* Fix startup crash if startup is interrupted.



Changes 4.0.9 -> 4.1.0:
* Add bypass button to native VST GUI windows
* Windows: Fix always-on-top for VST GUIs (i.e. avoid
  sub windows to appear behind the main VST GUI window).
* Add option to the preferences to disable always-on-top
  for VST GUIs.
* Fix latency compensation when dry/wet value is less than
  100%, or we are bypassing.
* Timeskew: Optionally report latency for positive skew values.
  (Practical when testing latency compensation)
* VST timing info: Ensure bar start value is correct when
  starting to play.
* Add plugin latency compensation to editor events (e.g. note
  on / note off, automation, pitch, etc.) when a plugin
  with latency is input-connected.
* Add latency compensation to VST timing data, if needed.
* Fix semi-rare startup crash introduced in 4.0.8.



Changes 4.0.8 -> 4.0.9:
* Use system font size to determine the height of the "Grab keyboard" check box
* Some ubsan fixes
* Don't show those tiny pitch lines if a track plays the same pitch for all notes
* Detect if instrument receives, generates, or sends out very powerful signals,
  and show a warning if they do.



Changes 4.0.7 -> 4.0.8:
* Add "Grab keyboard" checkbox to the VST GUI windows.
* Windows: Fix keyboard focus in VST plugins.
* Rename "Paste Preset(s)" to "Paste sound object(s)".



Changes 4.0.6 -> 4.0.7:
* Show load/paste preset and VST plugins first in instrument popup menu.
* Don't allow copying a permanent sound object to the clipboard.
  (i.e. a bus or the main pipe.)
* Fix autoconnect and auto position when creating new instrument
  from track header.



Changes 4.0.5 -> 4.0.6:
* Show note about autobackup in the preferences window.
  Autopackup is not performed while playing.
* Fix bug when pressing backspace at line 0 and the end position
  of a note was between line 0 and line 1.
* Disable minimize and maximze buttons on the GUI of native VST plugins.
  This fixes strange situation when putting VST plugin in full screen on OSX.
* Only render soundfile if there is a "System Out" instrument in the mixer.
* Cut/copy/paste sound objects
* Load/save multiple presets
* Fix very small timing error when block multiplier does not have
  the value 1.0. This means that older songs with a block
  multiplier != 1.0 will not play correctly, although it is
  likely not noticable.
* Don't show assertion reporter when recording failed.
* Fix selecting "Reset" when right clicking on a slider.
* sample recording: Set middle note in smpl chunk instead
  of setting an uncommon sample rate.
* Get middle note from the "instr" chunk, if it exists,
  and there was no "sampl" chunk. Untested though, since I don't
  have a sound file with "an nstr" chunk.
* Get middle note from the "sampl" chunk in wav files, if present.
* Start audio recording sample accurately.
* Update peaks in realtime when recording audio.



Changes 4.0.4 -> 4.0.5:
* Fix modifier keys on OSX.
* Don't crash if deleting the instrument while recording audio.



Changes 4.0.3 -> 4.0.4:
* Revert most of the keyboard changes in 4.0.3 since it caused various problems.
  However, although detecting autorepeat on linux doesn't quite work now,
  on OSX and Windows the functionality should be the same as in 4.0.3, apart
  from the bugs.
* Option to record audio into sampler instrument. (Hard drive, multitrack recording)
* Some attempts to track down and prevent one autopeported crash when deleting instrument.



Changes 4.0.2 -> 4.0.3:
* Fix player pausing when using play cursor (noticable for instance
  when changing tempo while playing)
* Option to render range to soundfile
* Only show .rad files in file requester when saving song
* Make alt+w/ctrl+w widen automation area(s) as well,
  not just the note area.
* Attempts to fix reported startup crash using debian + OpenGL 2.0.
* play range: Ensure nothing is played below the range. (It could
  sometimes happen before). There is still a little delay right
  before starting to play the range again (when looping),
  but this delay has been reduced significantly.
* Fix program freeze that could happen if trying to play a very
  small range, block or song. (range/block/song length must probably
  be less than 5 milliseconds)
* Very simple fx quantization. (Keep last value only)
* Add "Add automation to current track" slider option
* VST: Automatically switch tab when changing parameter in external GUI
* Only disable keyboard autorepeat when playing samples.
* velocity text: Dont show last velocity value if the previous node was non-glide.
  (to avoid unnecessary "xxx" values)
* Windows: Remove "AltGr -> play block" from the menues since it often doesn't work.
* The FaustDev instrument has been removed from the Linux binaries for now.
  Hopefully this makes the Linux binaries run on Ubuntu 16.
* Workarounds to avoid crashes in the TAP reflector plugin, and possibly
  other TAP plugins.
* Actually reduce crackling when playing an instrument for the first time
  if using very low jack buffer size, or the CPU is very busy.
  (It was only applied in the debug builds in 4.0.2.)
* Include fftw3 libraries in the Windows and OSX releases.
  Many additional LADSPA plugins are loading now. Pitch shifters, etc.



Changes 4.0.1 -> 4.0.2:
* Slider text: show value set by the user, not the current
  value. (The current value can be also be set automation).
* Reduced instrument memory usage significantly.
* Reduce crackling when playing an instrument for the first time
  if using very low jack buffer size, or the CPU is very busy.
* Fix quick-selecting preset.



Changes 4.0.0 -> 4.0.1:
* Ignore keyboard when the mixer has focus

  a popup menu is show with the existing presets in the last used preset directory,
  plus an option to load a preset from a different directory.
* MIDI learn can also lear from input event connections.
* MIDI Messages instrument: Fix CC values for the general purpose controllers.
  The instrument sent out 16/17/18/19 instead of 80/81/82/83.
* Fix MIDI port name display in the MIDI learn configuration window.
* Grey out editor when editor doesn't have keyboard focus.
* Desparate attempt to find a workaround for rare OSX startup crash.
  (Please report if OSX still sometimes crashes on startup.)
* Fix crash during startup on OSX when jack is not running.
* Don't show assertion window when trying to load non-working preset file.
* OSX: Don't wait for diagnotic report in the crashreporter when we show assertion
  instead of crash. Before this fix, the crashreporter window popped up at least
  20 seconds after the assertion happened, and therefore a provided user
  description about what happened could be quite useless.
* Fix double scroll wheel events, and possibly other types
  of doubly reported mouse events as well. (Qt5 fix)
* Experimental option to prepare opengl data in separate thread. This helps making
  rendering smooth when there's lots of graphical data. Turned off by default.
* Fix mouse drag not always working when dragging too fast
  or gfx is slow because of much graphical data. (Qt5 fix)
* Increase rendering performance for blocks with many lines.
  Changing the LZ value shouldn't change performance that much anymore.



Changes 3.9.9 -> 4.0.0:
* Automation record: Don't show assertion warning when trying (and failing)
  to add a new fx automation point at the same time position as an already
  existing fx automation point.
* Thicker non-line-aligned beat lines. (0.6 pixels -> 2.3 pixels)
* Fix memory corruption when rendering block with non-line-aligned
  beat lines.
* Option to render multiple sound files, one for each instrument.
* Fix memory corruption when using VST plugins. (bug introduced in 3.9.9)
* Fix rare startup crash. (bug introduced in 3.9.9)
* Fix crash when removing the system out instrument or loading
  a song where the system out instrument has been removed.
  (bug introduced in 3.9.9)
* Reorganize project menu a little bit.
* Fix note duplicator horizontal gui stretch.
* Fix play cursor following. It didn't always follow.
* Keep sample read position when switching from ping-pong
  to non-ping-pong while playing.
* Fix a MIDI record position inaccuracy which could happen
  when switching to a block with a different length than the
  previous one.



Changes 3.9.8 -> 3.9.9:
* Don't let shift + mouse scroll wheel move editor cursor left/right.
* Cut/copy/paste individual fx-es in tracks.
* Record automation. (right-click a slider)
* Changed default play cursor color to black, and increased width to 4 pixels.
* Ensure the bottom bar volume slider is always updated.
* Don't show assertion window when loading older song with fxs->effectnum != fxs->fx->effect_num
* Fix track cut
* Fix copying/pasting/cutting tempo tracks
* More accurate play range looping.

* Use non-native color selector on OSX (i.e. no separate window).
* MIDI learn. (right-click a slider or right-click a check box)
* Fix MIDI instrument widget stretch
* No 2-3 seconds freeze on Windows after starting up.



Changes 3.9.7 -> 3.9.8:
* Turn off custom put-dialog-in-front system. Using the Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint flag instead.
  (Less weird behavior when raising windows in front of others.)
* Fix "Make track monophonic". It didn't handle velocities and pitch changes,
  and it didn't create undo data at the correct time.
* Fix race condition when recording MIDI (fix rare crash).
* OSX: Fix VST plugin keyboard focus for qt5.
* Don't estimate monitor refresh rate when using qt5. The estimation is technically
  necessary since we need to know the refresh rate according to the sound card
  clock, and not the gfx card clock. But in practice it makes no difference since
  we interpolate the screen position anyway to avoid jumps. In qt5 there is a
  single function call to get the refresh rate without having to measure
  or dive into the OS APIs.
* Faust: Allocate hash tables with malloc to avoid large .bss sections
  (This causes shorter garbage collector pause times.)
* BDW-GC: Don't include data segments for dynamically loaded libraries.
  (This causes shorter garbage collector pause times.)
* Use Qt::FramelessWindowHint instead of Qt::Popup for the progress window,
  to avoid locking up the X server on Linux.
* Removed some unnecessary paint calls



Changes 3.9.6 -> 3.9.7:
* Fixed mod/xm import on OSX.
* OSX: dont show dock icons for the helper programs
* Clean up gfx update handling a bit. Should improve graphical performance.
* Remove some pre-opengl gfx buffers that were not used. Using less memory now,
  and resizing might be noticable faster.
* macosx: Enable full screen. Doesn't crash now, probably because of using Qt5 instead of Qt4.
* Progress dialog when opening songs.
* Option to save song with audio samples embedded. Works for the Sampler and
  Fluidsynth instruments. Could be useful when sending songs to other people
  or transfer songs between computers.
* Add Reverse and Ping-Pong loop to the sampler instrument
* Fix graphics for show/hide bpm track and tempo multiplier track
* Double the number of effect columns before using tabs.
* Tweak Patchbay gui a bit.
* Adjusted tapiir gui.
* Removed the custom Ctrl+C handler. Ctrl+C seems to work properly now without it.
* OpenGL: Call glMakeCurrent / glDoneCurrent before and after rendering each frame.
  Before we only called glMakeCurrent during program startup.
  Don't know if it makes a difference.
* disk: Give error message if the last step when saving
  a file (i.e. copying new file over the old file) failed.
* Fix bug that could cause non-glide automation not to be played.
* Force additional windows, such as the preferences window,
  to always display in front of the main window.
* Upgrade to Qt5. It seems like the seemingly
  random OpenGL related crashes are gone now.
* Some blocklist/playlist gfx tweaks
* Don't ask for effect display value string when
  the effect is an on/off button (crash fix)
* Fix pasting effects from other instruments
* Tweak when to paint stipled automation node lines



Changes 3.9.5 -> 3.9.6:
* Update bus slider strings immediately when changing a bus instrument name
* Fix freeze that could happen when pasting tracks and other situations
* Fix crash when pasting block using a sampler instrument pointing
  to a directory with lots of samples.

* Optimize rendering performance. Should especially be noticable
  on Windows 32 computers with slow disk.
* Apply faust scroll wheel behavior to the mixer and editor as well,
  and document this behavior in the help menu.
* Don't record CPU usage data for plugins that are not visible.
* Draw missing horizontal lines to connect nodes where glide is set to OFF.
  This is not only visually better, but also necessary in order
  to show the last values without enabling text.
* Update mute/solo/bypass buttons when automated
* Upgrade BDW garbage collector to 7.4.4
* More detailed information when getting "unknown effect number" error.
* Add missing sustain pedal effect name handling in
  the Fluidsynth instrument.

* Fix splitting block while playing
* Check errors when reading file from disk
* Gray out selected objects in the mixer again.



Changes 3.9.4 -> 3.9.5:

* Add separator between plugin and system effects in the effect popup menu.
* Start counting tab pages from 0 (not 1) in the plugin effect widgets.
* Don't play if pressing shift or altgr when the cursor is placed in a text field.
* Load song: Inform user when the effect names of a plugin has changed and
  will be ignored.
* LADSPA/Linux: Search for plugins in LADSPA_PATH (and bin/ladspa) before
  searching in the default locations.
* Don't create undo data when loading song, and when exiting.
* Ensure faust effect names are unique. Important when saving and
  loading songs since effects values are stored by name, not by index.
* Make sure editor is updated when the instrument widget automatically
  adjusts its height.

  instead of scrolling up / down
* Paint current connections in more distinct colors
* Fix 1L1 key on apple keyboards. On ISO keyboards the 1L1 key
  has moved down to the ZL1 key. Dont know how to detect whether
  we are using an apple or iso keyboard, but mac users probably
  usually use apple keyboards.
* OSX: Enable and fix crashreporter
* Wait until opengl widget has updated before returning
  from gl_create_window
* mouse: Fix editing lines below LZ * number of lines in block.
* Another attempt to fix window reconfiguration crash on osx.

  will be fixed later.
* Code cleanup
* api: many new functions and fixes for instruments and undo/redo
* Fix computer keyboard release key to stop playing note


Changes 3.7.7 -> 3.7.8:

* Recreate sound object if pasting a track using a deleted sound object
  (This also fixes crash if the track with the deleted sound object contained FX)
* Use floats for transpose in the note duplicator. Step also changed from 1 to 0.25.
* osx: Disable fullscreen (since it makes the program crash)
* player: Possible to change play position while playing

  None of those works properly (or at all) with Qt on windows.
* Render: Draw range better
* Copy/cut/paste automation range

* Scroll to the right line after changing block.
* Swapped default color 1 and 2
* default colors: Make range visible in a track without an instrument assigned

* Fix keyboard focus in vst path file dialog + possible crash on linux with older gfx drivers
* Compile with -Wextra
* Upgraded to faust 0.9.67
* Must always update editor as well after drawing other things
* Simplify end pitch. I.e. set it explicitly, dont automatically glide to the next note.
  Old songs are converted automatically when loading, but songs that glide to a note in a different
  block must be converted manually. This is not warned about though.
* Try to set default mixer zoom level based on system font size, plus always use font size 12
* Fix mouse state after right clicking a piano note
* Fix selecting and moving more than one sound object at once
* Multicore: Ensure sane number of CPUs.

Most important changes 3.3.0 -> 3.3.1
* Fix crash during startup on windows 32 bit.
  Bug (re)introduced in 3.3.0 (the NDEBUG option again).
* Fix a copy-and-paste error which caused ppqPositionOfLastBarStart
  to always have the value 0.0. Might make a difference
  on some VST plugins.
* Automatically uncheck the "GUI" button in the instrument
  widget if the native plugin gui was closed by closing
  the window directly.



Most important changes 3.2.9 -> 3.3.0
* Windows: Turn off jack "-S" checking in production again. Still doesn't work.
* Don't inform more than one time about a newer version of radium
* Removed comment in the preferences dialog about MultiCore being
  an experimental feature. It seems stable.
* windows: Use a home made jack process thread to make the unhandled
  exceptions filter work also when crashing in the main audio thread.
* Pause the gl thread for a second when opening a new window or dialog.
  This might prevent some crashes caused by buggy gfx driver
* Turn off modal windows by default for AMD/catalyst and Intel drivers

Most important changes 3.2.8 -> 3.2.9
* Windows: Don't start crash reporter all the time when loading and using VST plugins.
  Bug was introduced in V3.2.5
* VST: load/save FXB and FXP files
* Fix note add bug. Dont make it polyphonic unless polyphonic is true. Bug was introduced in V3.2.4.
* Update instrument widget after undo/redo (fix for non-moving peaks after undoing/redoing)
* Try to fix cpu label width in Windows
* Do automatic backup every minute if there are unsaved edits and radium is not playing.
  The backup interval can be changed in the preferences. It can also be turned off.
* Replaced a bunch of calls to RError with calls to GFX_Message
  (RError was used the wrong way, causing uses messages to be reported as program errors)
* Always show message if there is a disk error
* Write to temporary file first if saving to an existing file to avoid destroying an
  existing file if saving fails
* Tried to improve stability after jack has shut down. Still not working well though.
  User should not do anything else than save and exit if jack shuts down.
* Fix plugin names in crashreporter when running multi core



Most important changes 3.2.7 -> 3.2.8
* Remove sound object from mixer before freeing buffers (might fix mysterious crashes)
* Fix audio glitches when changing number of CPUs
* Show the crash/assert window for most warning/error messages
* Fix a LADSPA bug where sometimes the effects were set to default after undoing a deletion.
* api: printMixerTree (mostly for debugging)
* Finding peaks is approx. 2-4 times faster by using code from the JUCE SDK.
  (juce::FloatVectorOperations::findMinAndMax)
* Made the CPU widget fixed size. The bottom bar doesn't move left and right anymore.
* Removed old sound object scheduling system. Everything now goes through
  through the multicore scheduler, even when running single-threadedly.
* Fixed realtime update of waveforms when changing track volume and track panning
* Rewrote bus system. Buses are now just hidden sound object connections. Can in some
  situations improve multicore performance.
* Draw current sound object in darker color when selecting with
  left button, not only right button


Most important changes 3.2.6 -> 3.2.7
* Mixer: Must press left mouse button on a sound object to select it. Dont just set the the one currently under the mouse.
* Added volume value to connections. This is both necessary to later optimize/simplify
  the bus system (especially in conjuction with multi core), and to be able to control the volume of a connection.
* Dont start making an audio connection in the mixer if the start pos doesnt have inputs or outputs
* Fixed a bug which could cause the program to freeze when deleting sound objects,
  loading songs, undoing, redoing, etc. Bug was introduced in V3.2.2.
  *** Radium between V3.2.2 and V3.2.6 are particulary unstable. ***
* Make sure song comment window is shown on top of all other windows after loading a song.



Most important changes 3.2.5 -> 3.2.6
* Fix: 1. General realtime performance, and: 2. Crashes when multicore is enabled.
  (Don't use QString in realtime code, and especially don't access the same QString from several threads simultaneously.)
  Bug introduced in 3.2.5.
* Always block crash/assert-reporter in non-RELEASE mode, and never block in RELEASE mode
* Avoid showing assert reporter when exiting after jack has shut down.


Most important changes 3.2.4 -> 3.2.5
* Start crashreporter also when just hitting an assert.
* Improved crash reporter. Should hopefully work better in Windows.
  The reports also includes a simple event log now.



Most important changes 3.2.3 -> 3.2.4
* Make all dialogs modal by default if using intel or binary amd driver on linux (to avoid crashes)
* Ensure all notes starts before they end, when recording from MIDI input.
* Various note positions and value validations
* Unset OPENSSL_CONF environment variable during startup. Fixes rare crashes during startup.



Most important changes 3.2.2 -> 3.2.3
* Fix qt version mismatch problem on linux binaries (and possibly windows and osx as well)
* windows: Fix search for missing "-S" argument for jackd.
* Replaced the use of QSemaphore with a native one based
  on this code: https://github.com/preshing/cpp11-on-multicore/blob/master/common/sema.h
  The previous code could in rare situations cause priority inversion.
* Improved multi core a lot. Seems to work fine on Windows now.



Most important changes 3.2.1 -> 3.2.2
* Show message during startup if there is a newer version of the program available.
* Reorganized the edit menu a little bit
* Moved show/hide line numbers configuration from the menues and into the preferences dialog
* Windows: Don't inform that Radium was unable to find jack process command line arguments in RELEASE builds
* "CPU": Show min/avg/max instead of just max. Useful while figuring out multi core implementation.
  (it's not working that well on Windows yet)
* Remove some unnecessary locking/waiting in the multicore scheduler
  (probably has very little impact on performance though)



Most important changes 3.2.0 -> 3.2.1
* Another default color scheme. A little bit darker and white text.
* Increase default font size from 10 to 11 to get less flickering when using a white-on-black color scheme
* Make color schemes with white text on black background look better.
* Shut down jack at the right moment. Avoids crash at exit.
* Fix some mixer UI/GUI issues.
* Changed various button handlers from "pressed" callbacks into "clicked" callbacks.
  Fixes buttons stuck in pressed state.
* Removed the "scrollplay" and "window update" options from the menues.
* Moved the MIDI preferences stuff from the MIDI menu and into the preferences dialog
* Band-aid to avoid crash if song is saved with a patch that has no corresponding chip.
* Tooltip for the quantization value in the MIDI post-recording dialog.
* Also delete elinks when deleting all connections, not just the links.
  Fixes crash if redoing an undoing of a deletion of a sound object.
* Improve multi core by running most cpu intensive sound objects first
* CPU: Show the maximum CPU usage which was measured during the last second,
  not just the current CPU usage.
* Include the custom qjackctl in the 32 bit windows binaries, not just
  the 64 bit binaries.



Most important changes 3.1.4 -> 3.2.0
* Include a custom version of qjackctl in the Windows version. (i.e the "Jack Command" program)
  Hopefully there will be less struggle to start jack now since this version has better default
  options and some bugs fixed.
* Ensure all source files are compiled with sse support (-mfpmath=sse -msse2) in the binaries.
* Move scrollplay and the "multiply etc." option into the preferences dialog under a new "Edit" tab.
* Save scrollplay in config file
* Rename the default "Chorus" and "Reverb" buses to "Corus Bus" and "Reverb Bus"
* Moved OpenGL, CPU and VST preferences into a new Preferences dialog.
* Dont stop processing plugins if using too much CPU. Some plugins might overcompensate when
