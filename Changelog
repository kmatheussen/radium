Most important changes 3.3.0 -> 3.3.1
* Fix crash during startup on windows 32 bit.
  Bug (re)introduced in 3.3.0 (the NDEBUG option again).
* Fix a copy-and-paste error which caused ppqPositionOfLastBarStart
  to always have the value 0.0. Might make a difference
  on some VST plugins.
* Automatically uncheck the "GUI" button in the instrument
  widget if the native plugin gui was closed by closing
  the window directly.



Most important changes 3.2.9 -> 3.3.0
* Windows: Turn off jack "-S" checking in production again. Still doesn't work.
* Don't inform more than one time about a newer version of radium
* Removed comment in the preferences dialog about MultiCore being
  an experimental feature. It seems stable.
* windows: Use a home made jack process thread to make the unhandled
  exceptions filter work also when crashing in the main audio thread.
* Pause the gl thread for a second when opening a new window or dialog.
  This might prevent some crashes caused by buggy gfx driver
* Turn off modal windows by default for AMD/catalyst and Intel drivers
  on Linux since the pausing seems to fix the crashes




Most important changes 3.2.8 -> 3.2.9
* Windows: Don't start crash reporter all the time when loading and using VST plugins.
  Bug was introduced in V3.2.5
* VST: load/save FXB and FXP files
* Fix note add bug. Dont make it polyphonic unless polyphonic is true. Bug was introduced in V3.2.4.
* Update instrument widget after undo/redo (fix for non-moving peaks after undoing/redoing)
* Try to fix cpu label width in Windows
* Do automatic backup every minute if there are unsaved edits and radium is not playing.
  The backup interval can be changed in the preferences. It can also be turned off.

  (RError was used the wrong way, causing uses messages to be reported as program errors)
* Always show message if there is a disk error
* Write to temporary file first if saving to an existing file to avoid destroying an
  existing file if saving fails
* Tried to improve stability after jack has shut down. Still not working well though.
  User should not do anything else than save and exit if jack shuts down.
* Fix plugin names in crashreporter when running multi core



Most important changes 3.2.7 -> 3.2.8
* Remove sound object from mixer before freeing buffers (might fix mysterious crashes)
* Fix audio glitches when changing number of CPUs
* Show the crash/assert window for most warning/error messages
* Fix a LADSPA bug where sometimes the effects were set to default after undoing a deletion.
* api: printMixerTree (mostly for debugging)

* Removed old sound object scheduling system. Everything now goes through
  through the multicore scheduler, even when running single-threadedly.
* Fixed realtime update of waveforms when changing track volume and track panning
* Rewrote bus system. Buses are now just hidden sound object connections. Can in some
  situations improve multicore performance.
* Draw current sound object in darker color when selecting with
  left button, not only right button


Most important changes 3.2.6 -> 3.2.7
* Mixer: Must press left mouse button on a sound object to select it. Dont just set the the one currently under the mouse.
* Added volume value to connections. This is both necessary to later optimize/simplify
  the bus system (especially in conjuction with multi core), and to be able to control the volume of a connection.
* Dont start making an audio connection in the mixer if the start pos doesnt have inputs or outputs
* Fixed a bug which could cause the program to freeze when deleting sound objects,
  loading songs, undoing, redoing, etc. Bug was introduced in V3.2.2.
  *** Radium between V3.2.2 and V3.2.6 are particulary unstable. ***
* Make sure song comment window is shown on top of all other windows after loading a song.



Most important changes 3.2.5 -> 3.2.6
* Fix: 1. General realtime performance, and: 2. Crashes when multicore is enabled.
  (Don't use QString in realtime code, and especially don't access the same QString from several threads simultaneously.)
  Bug introduced in 3.2.5.
* Always block crash/assert-reporter in non-RELEASE mode, and never block in RELEASE mode
* Avoid showing assert reporter when exiting after jack has shut down.


Most important changes 3.2.4 -> 3.2.5
* Start crashreporter also when just hitting an assert.
* Improved crash reporter. Should hopefully work better in Windows.
  The reports also includes a simple event log now.

* Replaced the use of QSemaphore with a native one based
  on this code: https://github.com/preshing/cpp11-on-multicore/blob/master/common/sema.h
  The previous code could in rare situations cause priority inversion.
* Improved multi core a lot. Seems to work fine on Windows now.



Most important changes 3.2.1 -> 3.2.2
* Show message during startup if there is a newer version of the program available.
* Reorganized the edit menu a little bit
* Moved show/hide line numbers configuration from the menues and into the preferences dialog

* "CPU": Show min/avg/max instead of just max. Useful while figuring out multi core implementation.
  (it's not working that well on Windows yet)
* Remove some unnecessary locking/waiting in the multicore scheduler
  (probably has very little impact on performance though)



Most important changes 3.2.0 -> 3.2.1
* Another default color scheme. A little bit darker and white text.
* Increase default font size from 10 to 11 to get less flickering when using a white-on-black color scheme
* Make color schemes with white text on black background look better.
* Shut down jack at the right moment. Avoids crash at exit.
* Fix some mixer UI/GUI issues.
* Changed various button handlers from "pressed" callbacks into "clicked" callbacks.
  Fixes buttons stuck in pressed state.
* Removed the "scrollplay" and "window update" options from the menues.
* Moved the MIDI preferences stuff from the MIDI menu and into the preferences dialog
* Band-aid to avoid crash if song is saved with a patch that has no corresponding chip.
* Tooltip for the quantization value in the MIDI post-recording dialog.
* Also delete elinks when deleting all connections, not just the links.
  Fixes crash if redoing an undoing of a deletion of a sound object.
* Improve multi core by running most cpu intensive sound objects first
* CPU: Show the maximum CPU usage which was measured during the last second,
  not just the current CPU usage.
* Include the custom qjackctl in the 32 bit windows binaries, not just
  the 64 bit binaries.



Most important changes 3.1.4 -> 3.2.0
* Include a custom version of qjackctl in the Windows version. (i.e the "Jack Command" program)
  Hopefully there will be less struggle to start jack now since this version has better default
  options and some bugs fixed.

* Move scrollplay and the "multiply etc." option into the preferences dialog under a new "Edit" tab.
* Save scrollplay in config file
* Rename the default "Chorus" and "Reverb" buses to "Corus Bus" and "Reverb Bus"
* Moved OpenGL, CPU and VST preferences into a new Preferences dialog.
* Dont stop processing plugins if using too much CPU. Some plugins might overcompensate when
  they start again. Instead just stop playing, and if that didn't help,
  stop processing plugins as well.
* Fix soundfile saving (don't stop because using too much CPU)
* Show warning message if unable to acquire real time priority
* Multithreaded audio processing (i.e. "Multi-core")



Most important changes 3.1.3 -> 3.1.4

* Add "replace" button to instrument widget
* Send inital values first time a "MIDI Messages" object is playing.
* Fix plugin info dialog
* VST: Update Radium sliders when changing controllers in native GUI.
  This indirectly causes automation to update the sliders as well, but that's actually
  what happens underneath for VST plugins too, so that's a good thing.
* Rendering: Reset gfx timing when jumping to the start of a block.
  (removes the "dragged by a spring" effect)
* Linux: Show info during startup about the Gallium AMD OpenGL driver (if using that driver)

  to other sound objects. Can for instance be used to send pitch bend changes to VST plugins.
* Option to show linenumbers instead of bars/beats
* Updated ladspa rdf info for the kokkinizita plugins.
* Customly compiled LADSPA plugins for OSX, Win32, and Win64. The included
  plugin sets are now: calf, caps, cmt, swh, tap, and all kokkinizita plugins.
* 64 binaries for windows
* Include instructions on how to get audio from other simultaneously running ASIO programs
  in and out of the Radium mixer.
