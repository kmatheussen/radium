Radium V3.2.1
Released 2015-07-14



HOW TO MAKE IT RUN

          1. If you have a Fedora or Ubuntu/Debian-based distribution, first install dependencies.
             Required packages are listed below in this README.

          2. Do this:

          "
          touch audio/*.cpp common/gfx_op_queue_generated.c common/visual_op_queue_proc.h
          make packages
          BUILDTYPE=RELEASE ./build_linux.sh -j7
          ./start.sh
          "



IF YOU GOT THE SOURCE FROM GIT

   In general, after a git clone, you must also do:

          touch audio/*.cpp common/gfx_op_queue_generated.c common/visual_op_queue_proc.h

   And after a git pull, you must do:
          make very_clean

     (since not all dependencies are tracked in the makefile)




IF YOU ARE A DEVELOPER
         ./make_and_run_linux.sh



INTRODUCTION
        Radium is a free (as in speech) music editor with a novel interface.
        It's inspired by trackers, but has fewer limitations and uses graphics to show musical data. 



BUILD DEPENDENCIES, all platforms:

        * VST headers from steinberg. The necessary files should be incuded in
          "VST Audio Plug-Ins SDK", which you can download here:

             http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

         After downloading the VST SDK, unpack it and copy the 2.x headers into your ~/SDKs folder.



BUILD DEPENDENCIES FEDORA:

        In addition to OpenGL, you also need:

        qt4-devel
        libXaw-devel
        python2-devel
        alsa-lib-devel
        jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
        libsamplerate-devel
        liblrdf-devel
        libsndfile-devel
        ladspa-devel

        (tested on Fedora 17/19/20/22 64 bit)



BUILD DEPENDENCIES UBUNTU 12 (plus Debian):
      * Main packages, Ubuntu 12:

      In addition to OpenGL, you also need:

      qt4-dev-tools
      libxaw7-dev
      python2-dev
      libasound2-dev
      libjack-jackd2-dev or libjack-jackd1-dev
      libsamplerate-dev
      liblrdf-dev
      libsndfile-dev
      ladspa-sdk
      glib2-dev
      calf-plugins
      binutils-dev
      libc6-dev
      tk8.5
      libogg-dev
      libvorbis-dev
      libspeex-dev
      fftw-dev
      fftw3-dev
      guile
      libxkbfile-dev
      xorg-x11-util-macros
      cmake
      libfreetype6-dev
      libxinerama-dev
      libxcursor-dev

      * Or in one line:

      sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev      qt4-dev-tools      libxaw7-dev       python2-dev       libasound2-dev       libjack-jackd2-dev     libsamplerate-dev       liblrdf-dev       libsndfile-dev      ladspa-sdk      glib2-dev      calf-plugins      binutils-dev      libc6-dev      tk8.5 libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libspeex-dev fftw-dev fftw3-dev guile libxkbfile-dev xorg-x11-util-macros cmake libfreetype6-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev


      * Ubuntu LTS: I needed glib-2.0-dev instead of glib2-dev, plus a package called libglib2.0-dev.
        I also needed to install python2.7-dev instead of python2-dev.

      * On debian stable, it has been reported that you also need libfftw3-dev.
        I've also got report that you need a package called libqt4-opengl-dev on debian.

      * Ubuntu 14: Replace glib-2.0-dev with libglib2.0-dev. Add libiberty-dev



TO ENABLE ALL KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS ON MAC OS X

      Then go to

          System Preferences -> Accessibility

     or

          System Preferences -> Universal Access

      ... and make sure the button "Enable access for assistive devices" is ON.    
      This button is placed at the bottom of the Accessibility page.
      (I don't know where the button is placed in the "Universal Access" page)

      This is necessary for Radium to be allowed to (temporarily) turn off OSX system shortcuts.
