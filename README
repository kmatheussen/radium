HOW TO MAKE IT RUN

          1. Install dependencies. See "BUILD DEPENDENCIES, *" below in this file.

          2. Inspect the file "configuration.sh" and see if you want to change anything.
	  
          3. Do this:

          "
          make packages
          BUILDTYPE=RELEASE ./build_linux.sh -j `nproc`
          QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=`$(./find_moc_and_uic_paths.sh qmake) -query QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS` bin/radium
          "

          Note: There is an install.sh script, and it works, but you don't need it to run the program.
 
          On Linux, Radium is officially distributed by Arch Linux, and you can find a derivation for NixOS here:
		  https://git.cfpi-fpsi.eu:8443/emil/radium-nixos
		  


IF YOU GOT THE SOURCE FROM GIT

     WARNING: Only release-tagged commits should be considered stable.
     If you only do "git clone" and compile that version of Radium, there's
     a good chance the program won't compile, or will crash.

     You can download a stable version of the source by doing:
     
         wget https://github.com/kmatheussen/radium/archive/<version>.tar.gz

     However, if you still want to use GIT, you sometimes have to execute
     
          make very_clean

     ...after a git pull, since not all dependencies are tracked in the makefile.



IF YOU ARE DEVELOPING RADIUM

     First inspect the file "configuration.sh" and see if you want to change anything.
	  
     Then run these lines:
     
        # Debug build. Lots of assertions. Very slow. Don't build this version if you are just testing the program.
        make packages # Only necessary one time.
        BUILDTYPE=DEBUG ./build_linux.sh -j`nproc` && ./run_gdb.sh

     There are three types of BUILD_TYPE:
     
        RELEASE    - Compiled with -O2/-O3 and without various assertions.
        DEBUG_FAST - Same as DEBUG + -O2/-O3. Quite slow, but usually acceptable.
        DEBUG      - Compiled with -O0/-ggdb + asan/etc + various assertions. Very slow if your
		     computer is from around 2013 or older. If so it's usually
                     better to use DEBUG_FAST and temporarily add -O0 to the Makefile for those files
                     where you need better debug info.



INTRODUCTION
        Radium is a free (as in speech) music editor with a novel interface.
        It's inspired by trackers, but has fewer limitations and uses graphics to show musical data. 



BUILD DEPENDENCIES

        * VST headers from steinberg. The necessary files should be incuded in
          "VST Audio Plug-Ins SDK", which you can download here:

             http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

         After downloading the VST SDK, unpack it into your ~/SDKs folder.
		 
         Update: Steinberg has removed the VST 2.4 headers from the VST SDK,
         so you need to download the VST 2.4 headers separately.
         They can be found on the internet.
         (Try searching for site:github.com AND "audioeffectx.h")
		 
       * Etc.
