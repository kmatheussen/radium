HOW TO MAKE IT RUN

          1. Install dependencies. See "BUILD DEPENDENCIES, *" below in this file.

          2. Do this:

          "
          export RADIUM_QT_VERSION=5
          make packages
          BUILDTYPE=RELEASE ./build_linux.sh -j `nproc`
          QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=`$(./find_moc_and_uic_paths.sh qmake) -query QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS` bin/radium
          "

          If you want to use clang instead of gcc, first run this line before running "make packages":
          export RADIUM_USE_CLANG=1


IF YOU GOT THE SOURCE FROM GIT

     WARNING: Only release-tagged commits should be considered stable.
     If you only do "git clone" and compile that version of Radium, there's
     a good chance the program won't compile, or will crash.

     You can download a stable version of the source by doing:
     
         wget https://github.com/kmatheussen/radium/archive/<version>.tar.gz

     However, if you still want to use GIT, you sometimes have to execute
     
          make very_clean

     ...after a git pull, since not all dependencies are tracked in the makefile.



IF YOU ARE DEVELOPING RADIUM
     If you want to use clang instead of gcc, first run this line before running "make packages" and "build_linux.sh":
     
        export RADIUM_USE_CLANG=1

     If you don't want to include the llvm backend for the faustdev instrument (for instance if you don't have llvm), run this line first:
     
        export INCLUDE_FAUSTDEV_BUT_NOT_LLVM="jadda"
        
     Then run these lines:
     
        # Debug build. Lots of assertions. Very slow. Don't build this version if you are just testing the program.
        export RADIUM_QT_VERSION=5
        export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=`$(./find_moc_and_uic_paths.sh qmake) -query QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS`
        make packages # Only necessary one time.
        BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG_FAST ./build_linux.sh -j`nproc` && ./run_gdb

     There are three types of BUILD_TYPE:
     
        RELEASE    - Compiled with -O2/-O3 and without various assertions.
        DEBUG_FAST - Same as DEBUG + -O2/-O3. Quite slow, but usually acceptable.
        DEBUG      - Compiled with -O0/-ggdb + fsan/etc + various assertions. Very slow, it's usually better to use DEBUG_FAST and temporarily add -O0 to
                     the Makefile for those files where you need better debug info, and recompile.



INTRODUCTION
        Radium is a free (as in speech) music editor with a novel interface.
        It's inspired by trackers, but has fewer limitations and uses graphics to show musical data. 



BUILD DEPENDENCIES, all platforms:

        * VST headers from steinberg. The necessary files should be incuded in
          "VST Audio Plug-Ins SDK", which you can download here:

             http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

         After downloading the VST SDK, unpack it into your ~/SDKs folder.

      * Ubuntu LTS: I needed glib-2.0-dev instead of glib2-dev, plus a package called libglib2.0-dev.
        I also needed to install python2.7-dev instead of python2-dev.

      * On debian stable, it has been reported that you also need libfftw3-dev.

      * Ubuntu 14: Replace glib-2.0-dev with libglib2.0-dev. Add libiberty-dev
