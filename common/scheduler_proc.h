This is for the backtrace of a bug where two stopnotes are sent out instead of one.
Two stop notes are sent out at the top of the block, when played for the second time.
  It happens if:
1. The block has one note at the beginning of the track.
2. The note doesnt end.

It could seem like it happens in InitPEQendnote, where PC_InsertElement2 might not set correct time if playlistaddpos has the value 2.
However, the code is so hairy, that I hope it doesnt have any other consequences than the above scenario.
Furthermore, this scenario is not a big problem since sending out two stop notes for only one play note should in the best case be a dummy operation,
and in the worst case it could turning off all sound if two similar notes are playing at the same time.
But the worst case situation is not an important situation to handle properly, since you shouldnt play two similar notes at the same time anyway.
