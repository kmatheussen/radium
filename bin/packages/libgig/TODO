In General:
  - introduce 'iterator' design pattern as a replacement for the simple but
    error-prone GetFirstFoo() / GetNextFoo() methods

RIFF Part:
  - replace Chunk::SetPos(), Chunk::GetPos(), Chunk::Read() and
    Chunk::Write() methods and all other position dependant methods by a
    'Reader' / 'Writer' design pattern, that is each Chunk object would
    only provide a new instance to a 'Reader' / 'Writer' object which allows
    to read and write to the chunk independant how many parties are
    currently using the respective Chunk object for reading/writing

DLS Part:
  - support for conditional chunks
  - check for ZSTR terminated strings in DLS::Info::LoadString()
  - real support for 64 bit offsets (used by Gigasampler v3 files)
  - adding methods Articulator::AddArticulation() and
    Articulator::DeleteArticulation(Articulation* pArticulation) to allow
    creating and deleting DLS::Articulation objects
  - modify DLS::Articulation class to allow adding and deleting
    DLS::Connection objects

Gig Part:
  - support for <3dnl> chunk in gig::Region class which provides optional
    textual descriptions for dimensions
  - additional scan for compressed samples in
    gig::Sample::ScanCompressedSample() to build a table with the compression
    mode of each compressed frame in the sample allowing a more efficient
    Read() on runtime
  - low level optimization in decompression algorithm
  - optional writing of frame table to disk to speed up loading of compressed
    samples
  - support for creating and modifying compressed samples
