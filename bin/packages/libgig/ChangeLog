    - added missing parameter initalizations in sample, region and
      instrument constructors
    - clear unused fields when saving samples and regions
    - fixed write support bugs: v3 dimension limits and chunksize
      weren't saved, leverage controller of type controlchange
      couldn't be saved, group name list chunk was placed wrong,
      dimension region chunks also placed wrong
    - added initialization of some fixed info strings in file and
      instrument

      instruments
    - write support: improved the default values for dimension region
      parameters
    - more write support fixes: crossfade parameters were not saved,
      v3 dimension limits were not correctly initialized and saved
      when dimensions were added or deleted, v3 wave pool offsets were
      not saved correctly
    - write support: 24 bit samples can now be written
    - write support: version 3 is now the default for new files
    - more write support fixes: the 3ewg chunk is now bigger for v3,
      dimension regions without mapped samples are now allowed, 3gnl
      list in v3 files now always has 128 entries, several parameters
      where incorrectly saved due to an operator precedence mistake
    - DeleteSample now removes all references to the deleted sample
    - AddDimension now copies all parameters from existing dimension
      regions and also makes sure that the samplechannel dimension is
      placed first in the list of dimensions.
    - added method GetParent() to class 'DimensionRegion', which returns its
      parent Region
    - fixed Instrument::UpdateRegionKeyTable() method which did not reset
      unused areas

    - added support for custom splits points for other dimensions than
      velocity (gig v3 feature)
    - added "smart midi" and "round robin keyboard" dimensions
    - added new method File::DeleteGroupOnly() which only deletes the given
      group but moves all its members to another group, the other method,
      that is File::DeleteGroup() now removes not just the group, but also
      all the samples that belong to that group
    - fixed crash which occured on interfering File::DeleteSample() and
      File::GetNextSample() calls (due to iterator invalidation)
    - fixed group names which were not saved
    - fixed group destructor which did not remove the RIFF chunk associated
      with the group

    - fixed constructor for Region, which did not initialize correctly
      when used from Instrument::AddRegion
    - when saving, override the gig::Regions sample reference simply by
      the region's first dimension region's sample (avoids an exception
      when trying to save a new instrument)

      dimension definition fields

  * src/DLS.cpp, src/DLS.h:
    - added Instrument::MoveRegion method

      instead of the wave chunk
    - keyswitching dimension is changed from split type "normal" to

      instead of an approximation
    - added VCFCutoffControllerInvert parameter and GetVelocityCutoff
      function to DimensionRegion

  * src/DLS.cpp, src/DLS.h:

      (patch by Andreas Persson)
    - added some file format compatibility checks
    - fixed vcf_type_lowpassturbo value (vcf_type_lowpassturbo was actually

    - fixed / improved accuracy of all three velocity to volume
      transformation functions a.k.a. 'nonlinear','linear','special'
      (patch by Andreas Persson)
    - denormals are filtered from the velocity to volume tables
    - bugfix for dimension region switching (wrong handling of the release
      trigger dimension, no bit range check for dimensions of split type
      'split_type_bit')
    - fixed panorama value in DimensionRegion (invalid conversion from
      signed 7 bit to signed 8 bit)
    - added class attribute 'Layers' to class 'gig::Region'
    - symbol prototyping of gig::Region (fixes build failure with qsampler)

Version 0.7.1 (2 Jul 2004)

  * packaging changes:
    - added libgig.spec and libgig.pc package configurations for generating
      Redhat packages
    - header files included on installation.
    - autotools-generated files removed from CVS repository.
    - added support for generating Debian packages
    - version of shared library can be set in configure.in

Version 0.7.0 (3 May 2004)

  * general changes:
    - various big endian specific corrections
      (successfully tested now on PPC)
    - minor adjustments to avoid compile errors on some systems
      (using now pow() instead of powl() and --pedantic g++ compiler switch)
    - libtoolized the library
    - added man pages for the command line tools
      (gigextract, gigdump, dlsdump, rifftree)

  * src/gig.cpp, src/gig.h:
    - fixed bug in decompression algorithm which caused it not to detect
      the end of a stream
    - added method GetVelocityAttenuation() to class 'DimensionRegion' which
      takes the MIDI key velocity value as an argument and returns the
      appropriate volume factor (0.0 ... 1.0) for the sample to be played
      back, the velocity curve transformation functions used for this are
      only an approximation so far
    - fixed class attributes 'Sample::LoopStart', 'Sample::LoopEnd' and
      'Sample::LoopSize' which reflected wrong values
    - class attributes 'Sample::LoopStart' and 'Sample::LoopEnd' are now
      measured in sample points instead of byte offset
    - renamed misleading attribute name 'Sample::MIDIPitchFraction' to
      'Sample::FineTune'
    - added class attribute 'Sample::LoopSize'
    - added method GetInstrument(uint index) to class 'File'
    - added ReadAndLoop() method to class 'Sample' which is an extension to
      the normal Read() method to honor the sample's looping information
      while streaming from disk
    - changed interface for 'attenuation_ctrl_t', 'eg1_ctrl_t' and
      'eg2_ctrl_t': replaced this huge enumeration by a structure which
      reflects the MIDI controller number in case of an ordinary control
      change controller (this saves a huge switch-case block in the
      application of the library user)
    - renamed following attributes in class 'DimensionRegion':
      'AttenuationContol' -> 'AttenuationController',
      'InvertAttenuationControl' -> 'InvertAttenuationController',
      'AttenuationControlTreshold' -> 'AttenuationControllerThreshold'
    - minor fix in API documentation for method GetVelocityAttenuation() in
      class 'DimensionRegion'

  * src/RIFF.cpp, src/RIFF.h:
    - added additional API documentation
    - minor fix in Chunk::Read() method (only a minor efficiency issue)

    - added printout of samples' looping informations

Version 0.6.0 (3 Nov 2003)

  * initial release
