This directory contains the data used by Visualization Library tests and sample applications.

By default the data is looked for in the "../data" directory so if your binaries are located
into VL_SDK_PATH/bin your data should be located into VL_SDK_PATH/data.

You can also set the VL_DATA_PATH environment variable to point to the directory containing
Visualization Library's data.
