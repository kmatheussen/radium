Content
=======
  libgig actually consists of three major parts:

  - RIFF classes (RIFF.h, RIFF.cpp): Provides convenient methods to parse and
                                     access arbitrary RIFF files.
  - DLS classes (DLS.h, DLS.cpp):    They're using the RIFF classes to parse
                                     DLS (Downloadable Sounds) Level 1 and 2
                                     files and provide abstract access to the
                                     data.
  - gig classes (gig.h, gig.cpp):    These are based on the DLS classes and
                                     provide the necessary extensions for
                                     the Gigasampler/GigaStudio file format.

  Despite its name, libgig also provides (since version 4.0.0) support for
  other sampler file formats as well:

  - SoundFont classes (SF.h, SF.cpp):  They provide support for the very popular
                                       SoundFont v1 and v2 format (.sf2).

  - KORG classes (Korg.h, Korg.cpp):   Provides support for sample based sounds
                                       used on many KORG synthesizer keyboards.

  - Akai classes (Akai.h):             Currently S1000, S01, S2000 and S3000
                                       series are supported.

  Additionally libgig contains the following separate API:

  - Serialization classes (Serialization.h, Serialization.cpp):
                                       Framework to serialize and deserialize
                                       the runtime state of native C++ objects
                                       (for saving and restoring their states
                                       as abstract data).

  Beside the actual library there are following example applications:

    gigdump:     Demo app that prints out the content of a .gig file.
    gigextract:  Extracts samples from a .gig file.
    gigmerge:    Merges several .gig files to one .gig file.
    gig2mono:    Converts .gig files from stereo to mono.
    gig2stereo:  Converts .gig files to true interleaved stereo sounds.
    wav2gig:     Creates a new .gig file from a set of .wav files.
    dlsdump:     Demo app that prints out the content of a DLS file.
    korgdump:    Prints out the content of the various KORG file types.
    korg2gig:    Convert KORG sound file to Gigasampler/GigaStudio format.
    sf2dump:     Prints out the content of a .sf2 file.
    sf2extract:  Extracts audio samples from a .sf2 file.
    rifftree:    Tool that prints out the RIFF tree of an arbitrary RIFF
                 file.
    akaidump:    Dump an AKAI media i.e. from a CDROM drive as disk image file
                 to your hard disk drive.
    akaiextract: Extracts samples from an Akai disk image, either from a media
                 (i.e. CDROM or Zip drive) for from a AKAI disk image file.

  Since version 3.0.0 libgig also provides write support, that is for
  creating modifying .gig, DLS and RIFF files.

Requirements
============

  All systems
  -----------

  Since libgig 4.3.0 you need at least a C++11 compliant compiler.

  POSIX systems (e.g. Linux, macOS):
  ---------------------------------

  You need at least to have libtool installed to be able to build the
  library with "./configure && make".

  Additionally you need to have either libaudiofile (>= 0.2.3) or
  libsndfile (>= 1.0.2) installed which is mandatory to be able to compile
  the 'gigextract' example application. But of course 'gigextract' is still
  just an example application, so it would make sense to compile it only if
  one of those libraries are available. That would remove that hard
  dependency to those two libs. But that's not a priority for me now.
  Note: for Windows systems only libsndfile is available.

  If you want to regenerate all autotools build files (that is configure,
  Makefile.in, etc.) then you need to have automake (>= 1.5) and autoconf
  installed.

  Windows:
  --------

  The precompiled versions of libgig (and its tools) should be compatible
  with any Windows operating system of at least Win95 or younger. Notice
  that all example / demo applications coming with libgig are pure console
  applications, thus you won't see a GUI showing up! :)

  If you want to compile libgig and its tools by yourself, please also
  notice the requirements under "Compiling for Windows".

  Other Operating Systems:
  ------------------------

  libgig was written to compile for any operating system, using standard C
  library functions. However there are some OS dependent requirements:

  * Since libgig 3.0.0 an OS dependent implementation for a tiny method called
    RIFF::File::ResizeFile() is required. So you would either have to add
    native OS API calls for that particular method, that is dependant to your
    OS, or you have to add a portable implementation. No matter which way you
    choose, please let us know! :)

  * Since libgig 4.3.0 presence of some UUID generating function is required to
    be provided by the underlying system. This was an optional feature in
    previous versions of libgig for many years, its absence only meant that you
    were unable to load gig files created/modified by libgig to be accepted by
    Tascam's original GigaStudio studio software, did not mean any restriction
    for being used with LinuxSampler though. This has changed in the meantime,
    so this is now a hard build requirement, as you would potentially encounter
    misbehaviours now even if you stay entirely in the Linux eco system if UUIDs
    were missing in gig files.

Compiling for Linux
===================
  You can either compile the sources and install the library directly on
  your system or you can create Redhat or Debian packages.

  a) Compiling and installing directly

  Call './configure && make' on the console to compile the library, all
  tools and demo applications, documentation and install them with
  'make install'. The latter has to be called as root.

  If you are compiling from CVS you have to call 'make -f Makefile.cvs'
  to generate all autotools build files before calling
  './configure && make'.

  You can use 'make distclean' and probably 'make -f Makefile.cvs clean'
  to clean up everything again. The latter will also delete all automatic
  generated autools build files.

  b) Creating Debian packages

  Use 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b' to compile and create the Debian
  packages. This will generate 3 Debian packages:

    libgig:      Contains the shared library files.
    libgig-dev:  Contains the header files and documentation for building
                 applications using libgig.
    gigtools:    Contains the tools and demo applications.

  You can use 'fakeroot debian/rules clean' to clean up everything again.

  c) Creating Redhat packages

  You need to have the rpmbuild tool installed and properly configured to
  create RPM packages. To create the RPM packages do the following:

    * Get .spec file generated by ./configure and edit it as appropriate.

    * Copy the source tarball to "/usr/src/<rpmdir>/SOURCES" directory,
      where <rpmdir> is dependent to the system you are using. For SuSE
      <rmpdir> will be "packages", for Mandrake <rpmdir> is "RPM" and for
      Redhat / Fedora <rpmdir> always equals "redhat".

    * Build the rpm(s) by invoking 'rpmbuild -bb <specfile>' from the
      command line.

  On success, the resulting rpm(s) can usually be found under the proper
  "/usr/src/<rpmdir>/RPMS/<arch>" directory.

Compiling for Windows using CMake
=================================
The easiest way is to compile is to use vcpkg (https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
to install libsndfile (required). In the vcpkg install dir type:

.\vcpkg.exe install libsndfile [--triplet x64-windows]

This should install the libraries in vcpkg, add the triplet option if you wish to
get the 64bit libraries.

In an empty directory type:
cmake <libgig source dir> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg dir>\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
[-G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"]

Use the -G option to select the visual studio version and whether to compile for
64bits.

This will create libgig.sln file which you can open in visual studio or you can use
the following command line to compile:

cmake --build . --config <Release|Debug|MinRelSize|RelWithDebInfo>

Compiling for Windows using Dev-C++
===================================

  libgig and its tools can also be compiled on Windows using Bloodshed Dev-C++,
  which is a free (GPL) C++ integrated development environment for Windows.
  It is also possible to use MSYS from MinGW, which allows you to use
  './configure && make' like the linux builds.

  You can download Dev-C++ here:

    http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html

  Make sure you install a version with Mingw integrated.

  a) Compiling libgig.dll

  Simply open the project file "win32/libgig.dev" either directly in Dev-C++
  or by double clicking on the project file in the Windows explorer, then
  click on "Compile" in the Dev-C++ menu and that's it! After compilation
  finished, you can find the files "libgig.dll", "libgig.a" and
  "liblibgig.def" in the "win32" directory.

  b) Compiling the example tools "rifftree", "dlsdump" and "gigdump"

  You need to have libgig.dll compiled as described in a). Then you can
  compile the respective tool by simply opening the respective project
  (.dev) file and clicking on "Compile" from the Dev-C++ menu. After
  compilation you can find the respective .exe file in the "win32"
  directory.

  c) Compiling the example tool "gigextract"

  You need to have libgig.dll compiled as described in a). Also you need
  libsndfile (as DLL) which is used to create the .wav files. You can
  download libsndfile already precompiled as DLL here:

    http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

  Extract the .zip file i.e. to "C:\". The libsndfile .dll file should then
  be i.e. under "C:\libsndfile-1_0_17". Beside the .dll file, make sure
  libsndfile's .lib file exists in that directory as well. If the .lib file
  does not exist yet, you have to create it with:

    dlltool --input-def libsndfile-1.def --output-lib libsndfile-1.lib

  Then you have to ensure the settings of gigextract's Dev-C++ project file
  are pointing to the correct location of your local copy of libsndfile. For
  that click in the Dev-C++ menu on "Project" -> "Project Options". Then
  click on the tab "Parameter" and make sure the path to "libsndfile-1.lib"
  in the "Linker" list view is correct. Then click on the tab "Directories"
  and then on the tab "Include Directories" and make sure the path to
  libsndfile points to the correct location there as well.

  After that you should finally be able to compile "gigextract" by clicking
  on "Compile" in the Dev-C++ menu. After compilation succeeded, you can
  find the "gigextract.exe" file in the "win32" directory.

Test Cases
==========
  There are automated test cases which allow to automatically check libgig's
  functions behaving as expected on your system. These test cases are not
  compiled by default:

    * Run 'make check' from the toplevel source directory to compile and
      run all test cases.

License
=======
  libgig and its tools are released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

  libakai and its tools are released under the GNU Lesser General Public (LGPL).
  Due to its different license model the Akai support part is built as separate
  DLL (.so) file.

API Documentation
=================
  If you have Doxygen installed you can generate the API documentation by
  running 'make docs' in the sources' top level directory. The API
  documentation will be generated in the 'doc' subdirectory.

Patches
=======
  If you have bug fixes or improvements, your patches are always welcome!
  Send them either directly to me or to the LinuxSampler developer's mailing
  list <linuxsampler-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.

Bugs
====
  Please report bugs to the LinuxSampler Developers mailing list.

  You might also try to run the "Test Cases" coming with libgig (see above),
  especially in case you are running on an odd system.

Trademarks
==========
  Tascam, Gigasampler, GigaStudio, KORG, Trinity, Triton, OASYS, M3, Kronos
  and Akai are trademarks of their respective owners.

Credits
=======
  The initial library (Gigasampler part) was based on the reverse engineering
  effort of Paul Kellett and Ruben van Royen. We owe current support for the
  Gigasampler v3/v4 format to Andreas Persson. Please also have a look at the
  ChangeLog for all those who contributed.

  Akai support files are a ported version of Sébastien Métrot's libakai. The
  original libakai only supported Mac and Windows. This forked version of
  libakai now also supports Linux and other POSIX compliant operating systems
  as well and does not have a dependency to libngl as the original libakai had.

  The SoundFont 2 file format C++ classes were written by Grigor Iliev.

  Thanks to all of you for your great work!
