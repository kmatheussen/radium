  <h1>Signatures</h1>
  
  Signatures specify rhythm. It does so by specifying number of beats (in a bar) above beat type. For instance, a 4/4 signature means that there are 4 beats in the bar, and that each beat is a quarter.
  <p>
   Rhytm is used by external plugins, the metronome, modulators, and jack transport.
  <p>
    Here are some other common names for the term "signature": time signature, meter signature, meter, metre, measure, and measure signature. 
  <p>
  Example 1: If tempo is set to 64 BPM, and the signature is set to 8/8, a new bar will be played every 16 seconds (64/4 * 8/8), and a new beat will be played every 2 seconds (64/4 * 1/8). Example 2: If the signature is set to 2/4, a new bar will be played every 8 seconds (64/4 * 2/4), and a new beat will be played every 4 seconds (64/4 * 1/4).
