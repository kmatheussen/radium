<h1>Chance text</h1>

Chance text lets you set the probability for this note or pitch to play.
<p>
To enable Chance text, right-click inside a track and enable "Chance text".

<p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
Chance text format: <b>xx</b>, where 

 <b>0</b> = Only play if the previous note played. For instance if you want to play a chord with same chance.
 <b>1</b> = 0.004% chance.
..
<b>40</b> = 25% chance.
.. 
<b>80</b> = 50% chance.
..
<b>c0</b> = 75% chance.
..
<b>ff</b> = 99.6% chance.
<b>  </b> = 100% chance. (empty)
    </pre>

    <LI>To remove a chance text (to make sure the note is always played), press <b>DEL</b>.
    <LI>To control the chance of individual voices in the note duplicator,
      you can automate the instrument effects <b>System Chance 1</b>, <b>System Chance 2</b>, and so forth, instead.
      (Note that the value <b>ff</b> is interpreted as 256 when automating the chance
      of individual voices in the note duplicator so you don't have to worry about
      the voices not always playing.)
