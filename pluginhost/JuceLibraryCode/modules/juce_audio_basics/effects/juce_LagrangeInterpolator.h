/**
    Interpolator for resampling a stream of floats using 4-point lagrange interpolation.

    Note that the resampler is stateful, so when there's a break in the continuity
    of the input stream you're feeding it, you should call reset() before feeding
    it any new data. And like with any other stateful filter, if you're resampling
    multiple channels, make sure each one uses its own LagrangeInterpolator
    object.
