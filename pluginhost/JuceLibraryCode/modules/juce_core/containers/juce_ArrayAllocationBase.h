    Implements some basic array storage allocation functions.

    This class isn't really for public use - it's used by the other
    array classes, but might come in handy for some purposes.

    It inherits from a critical section class to allow the arrays to use
    the "empty base class optimisation" pattern to reduce their footprint.
