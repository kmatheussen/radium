/**
    A smart-pointer that automatically creates and manages the lifetime of a
    shared static instance of a class.

    The SharedObjectType template type indicates the class to use for the shared
    object - the only requirements on this class are that it must have a public
    default constructor and destructor.

    The SharedResourcePointer offers a pattern that differs from using a singleton or
    static instance of an object, because it uses reference-counting to make sure that
    the underlying shared object is automatically created/destroyed according to the
    number of SharedResourcePointer objects that exist. When the last one is deleted,
    the underlying object is also immediately destroyed. This allows you to use scoping
    to manage the lifetime of a shared resource.

    Note: the construction/deletion of the shared object must not involve any
    code that makes recursive calls to a SharedResourcePointer, or you'll cause
    a deadlock.

    Example:
    @code
    // An example of a class that contains the shared data you want to use.
    struct MySharedData
    {
        // There's no need to ever create an instance of this class directly yourself,
        // but it does need a public constructor that does the initialisation.
        MySharedData()
        {
            sharedStuff = generateHeavyweightStuff();
        }

        Array<SomeKindOfData> sharedStuff;
    };

    struct DataUserClass
    {
        DataUserClass()
        {
            // Multiple instances of the DataUserClass will all have the same
            // shared common instance of MySharedData referenced by their sharedData
            // member variables.
            useSharedStuff (sharedData->sharedStuff);
        }

        // By keeping this pointer as a member variable, the shared resource
        // is guaranteed to be available for as long as the DataUserClass object.
        SharedResourcePointer<MySharedData> sharedData;
    };

    @endcode
