/**
    Represents a linear source of mouse events from a mouse device or individual finger
    in a multi-touch environment.

    Each MouseEvent object contains a reference to the MouseInputSource that generated
    it. In an environment with a single mouse for input, all events will come from the
    same source, but in a multi-touch system, there may be multiple MouseInputSource
    obects active, each representing a stream of events coming from a particular finger.

    Events coming from a single MouseInputSource are always sent in a fixed and predictable
    order: a mouseMove will never be called without a mouseEnter having been sent beforehand,
    the only events that can happen between a mouseDown and its corresponding mouseUp are
    mouseDrags, etc.
    When there are multiple touches arriving from multiple MouseInputSources, their
    event streams may arrive in an interleaved order, so you should use the getIndex()
    method to find out which finger each event came from.
