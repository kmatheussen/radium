/**
    Enables drag-and-drop behaviour for a component and all its sub-components.

    For a component to be able to make or receive drag-and-drop events, one of its parent
    components must derive from this class. It's probably best for the top-level
    component to implement it.

    Then to start a drag operation, any sub-component can just call the startDragging()
    method, and this object will take over, tracking the mouse and sending appropriate
    callbacks to any child components derived from DragAndDropTarget which the mouse
    moves over.

    Note: If all that you need to do is to respond to files being drag-and-dropped from
    the operating system onto your component, you don't need any of these classes: you can do this
    simply by overriding Component::filesDropped().

        This starts a drag-and-drop operation - call it when the user drags the
        mouse in your drag-source component, and this object will track mouse
        movements until the user lets go of the mouse button, and will send
        appropriate messages to DragAndDropTarget objects that the mouse moves
        over.

                                    a snapshot of the sourceComponent will be used instead.
        @param allowDraggingToOtherJuceWindows   if true, the dragged component will appear as a desktop
                                    window, and can be dragged to DragAndDropTargets that are the
                                    children of components other than this one.

                                    at which the image should be drawn from the mouse. If it isn't
                                    specified, then the image will be centred around the mouse. If
                                    an image hasn't been passed-in, this will be ignored.
