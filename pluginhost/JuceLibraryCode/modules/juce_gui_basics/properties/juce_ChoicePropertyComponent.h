/**
    A PropertyComponent that shows its value as a combo box.

    This type of property component contains a list of options and has a
    combo box to choose one.

    Your subclass's constructor must add some strings to the choices StringArray
    and these are shown in the list.

    The getIndex() method will be called to find out which option is the currently
    selected one. If you call refresh() it will call getIndex() to check whether
    the value has changed, and will update the combo box if needed.

    If the user selects a different item from the list, setIndex() will be
    called to let your class process this.
