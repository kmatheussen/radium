    A progress bar component.

    To use this, just create one and make it visible. It'll run its own timer
    to keep an eye on a variable that you give it, and will automatically
    redraw itself when the variable changes.

    For an easy way of running a background task with a dialog box showing its
    progress, see the ThreadWithProgressWindow class.
