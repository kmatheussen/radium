/** An object that watches for any movement of a component or any of its parent components.

    This makes it easy to check when a component is moved relative to its top-level
    peer window. The normal Component::moved() method is only called when a component
    moves relative to its immediate parent, and sometimes you want to know if any of
    components higher up the tree have moved (which of course will affect the overall
    position of all their sub-components).

    It also includes a callback that lets you know when the top-level peer is changed.

    This class is used by specialised components like WebBrowserComponent or QuickTimeComponent
    because they need to keep their custom windows in the right place and respond to
    changes in the peer.
