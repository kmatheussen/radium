    This is the small triangular stripey resizer component you get in the bottom-right
    of windows (more commonly on the Mac than Windows). Put one in the corner of
    a larger component and it will automatically resize its parent when it gets dragged
    around.

        Pass in the target component which you want to be resized when this one is
        dragged.

        The target component will usually be a parent of the resizer component, but this
        isn't mandatory.

        Remember that when the target component is resized, it'll need to move and
        resize this component to keep it in place, as this won't happen automatically.

        limits on the size and position that the component can be stretched to. Make sure
        that the constrainer isn't deleted while still in use by this object. If you
        pass a zero in here, no limits will be put on the sizes it can be stretched to.
