    When the first instance of this class is created, it calls initialiseJuce_GUI(),
    and when the last instance is deleted, it calls shutdownJuce_GUI(), so that you
    can easily be sure that as long as at least one instance of the class exists, the
    library will be initialised.

    This class is particularly handy to use at the beginning of a console app's
    main() function, because it'll take care of shutting down whenever you return
    from the main() call.

    Be careful with your threading though - to be safe, you should always make sure
    that these objects are created and deleted on the message thread.
