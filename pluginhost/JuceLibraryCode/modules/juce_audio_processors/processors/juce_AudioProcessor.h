/**
    Base class for audio processing filters or plugins.

    This is intended to act as a base class of audio filter that is general enough to
    be wrapped as a VST, AU, RTAS, etc, or used internally.

    It is also used by the plugin hosting code as the wrapper around an instance
    of a loaded plugin.

    Derive your filter class from this base class, and if you're building a plugin,
    you should implement a global function called createPluginFilter() which creates
    and returns a new instance of your subclass.

        samples that will be processed for each callback, but isn't any kind

        each time the callback happens, and may be more or less than this value.

        When this method is called, the buffer contains a number of channels which is
        at least as great as the maximum number of input and output channels that
        this filter is using. It will be filled with the filter's input data and
        should be replaced with the filter's output.

        So for example if your filter has 2 input channels and 4 output channels, then
        the buffer will contain 4 channels, the first two being filled with the
        input data. Your filter should read these, do its processing, and replace
        the contents of all 4 channels with its output.

        Or if your filter has 5 inputs and 2 outputs, the buffer will have 5 channels,
        all filled with data, and your filter should overwrite the first 2 of these
        with its output. But be VERY careful not to write anything to the last 3
        channels, as these might be mapped to memory that the host assumes is read-only!

        Note that if you have more outputs than inputs, then only those channels that
        correspond to an input channel are guaranteed to contain sensible data - e.g.
        in the case of 2 inputs and 4 outputs, the first two channels contain the input,
        but the last two channels may contain garbage, so you should be careful not to
        let this pass through without being overwritten or cleared.

        Also note that the buffer may have more channels than are strictly necessary,
        but you should only read/write from the ones that your filter is supposed to
        be using.

        The number of samples in these buffers is NOT guaranteed to be the same for every
        callback, and may be more or less than the estimated value given to prepareToPlay().
        Your code must be able to cope with variable-sized blocks, or you're going to get
        clicks and crashes!

        If the filter is receiving a midi input, then the midiMessages array will be filled
        with the midi messages for this block. Each message's timestamp will indicate the
        message's time, as a number of samples from the start of the block.

        Any messages left in the midi buffer when this method has finished are assumed to
        be the filter's midi output. This means that your filter should be careful to
        clear any incoming messages from the array if it doesn't want them to be passed-on.

        Be very careful about what you do in this callback - it's going to be called by
        the audio thread, so any kind of interaction with the UI is absolutely
        out of the question. If you change a parameter in here and need to tell your UI to
        update itself, the best way is probably to inherit from a ChangeBroadcaster, let
        the UI components register as listeners, and then call sendChangeMessage() inside the
        processBlock() method to send out an asynchronous message. You could also use
        the AsyncUpdater class in a similar way.

        will shift the signal forward in time, possibly creating pre-echo effects and odd timings.

        also implement the hasEditor() method and make it return true.

        safely unregister themselves when they are deleted.

          not open one at all. Your filter mustn't rely on it being there.
