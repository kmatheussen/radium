    A graphical effect filter that can be applied to components.

    An ImageEffectFilter can be applied to the image that a component
    paints before it hits the screen.

    This is used for adding effects like shadows, blurs, etc.

        as its source, and should render its output to the graphics context passed in.

        @param destContext      the graphics context to use to draw the resultant image.
        @param scaleFactor      a scale factor that has been applied to the image - e.g. if
                                this is 2, then the image is actually scaled-up to twice the
