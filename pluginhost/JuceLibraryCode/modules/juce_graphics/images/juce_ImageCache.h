/**
    A global cache of images that have been loaded from files or memory.

    If you're loading an image and may need to use the image in more than one
    place, this is used to allow the same image to be shared rather than loading
    multiple copies into memory.

    Another advantage is that after images are released, they will be kept in
    memory for a few seconds before it is actually deleted, so if you're repeatedly
    loading/deleting the same image, it'll reduce the chances of having to reload it
    each time.
